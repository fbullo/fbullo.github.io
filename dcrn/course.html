<h1>Distributed Control of Robotic Networks</h1>
<div id="subtitle"><b>A Mathematical Approach to Motion Coordination Algorithms</b></div>
</div>
<p>The intended audience of this book are first- and second-year graduate
students in control and robotics from Computer Science, Electrical
Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Aerospace Engineering.  A
familiarity with basic concepts from analysis, linear algebra,
dynamical systems, and control theory is assumed. </p>
<p>Researchers in the fields of control theory and robotics who are not
aware of the literature on distributed algorithms will also benefit
from the book.  The book uses notions with a clear computer-science
flavor and integrates them into the study of robotic networks.
Likewise, researchers in the fields of distributed algorithms and
automata theory who are not aware of robotic networks and distributed
control will also find the book useful.  The numerous connections that
can be drawn between the classical study of distributed algorithms and
the present book provide a friendly roadmap to step into the field of
controlled coordination of robotic networks.</p>
<p>Our experience and opinion is that this text can be used for a
quarter or semester-long course on &lsquo;&lsquo;Distributed Control&rsquo;&rsquo; or on
&lsquo;&lsquo;Robotic Networks.&rsquo;&rsquo;  Such a course could be taught in an Engineering
or in a Computer Science department.  We have taught such a course at
our respective institutions over a 10 week, 3 hours per week, period,
skipping some material and some proofs (e.g., skipping combinatorial
optimization in Chapter&nbsp;1, some of the multicenter functions and the
nonconvex geometry treatment in Chapter&nbsp;2, and the relative-sensing
model in Chapter&nbsp;3).  With proofs and more complete treatment, we
estimate the material might require 45 hours of lecture time.</p>
