  abstract =      {Several theorems are presented which predict in a
                   qualitative manner the behavior of a large class of
                   dynamic nonlinear networks containing coupled and
                   multiterminal resistors, inductors, and capacitors. A
                   very general and rather surprising result is
                   presented which guarantees that most autonomous and
                   nonautonomous dynamic nonlinear active networks of
                   practical interest have no finite "forward" escape
                   time solutions. In the case of autonomous networks,
                   sufficient conditions are given which guarantee that
                   the solution waveforms possess various forms of
                   stability properties. The concepts of eventual
                   passivity and eventual strict passivity are invoked
                   to guarantee that all solution waveforms are bounded
                   and eventually uniformly bounded, respectively. The
                   properties of reciprocity and monotonicity (local
                   passivity) are invoked to guarantee that all
                   solutions are completely stable. The further
                   imposition of a growth condition guarantees that all
                   solutions will converge to a globally asymptotically
                   stable equilibrium point. In this case, the magnitude
                   of all solutions is shown to be bounded between two
                   exponential waveforms for all timet > 0. An algorithm
                   is presented which computes for the maximum
                   "transient decay" time constant associated with the
                   upper bounding exponential. The main features of the
                   majority of the theorems presented in this paper are
                   that their hypotheses are simple and easily
                   verifiable-often by inspection. The hypotheses are of
                   two types: first, very general conditions on the
                   network state equations and second, conditions on the
                   individual element characteristics and their
                   interconnections. The hypotheses and proofs of the
                   latter type of theorems depend heavily upon the
                   graphtheoretic results of an earlier paper [14] and
                   involve solely the examination of the global nature
                   of each element's constitutive relation and the
                   verification of a topological "loop-cutset"
                   conditions.},

  volume =        {62},
  year =          {1978},
  abstract =      {In this paper, we extend the concept of the measure
                   of a matrix to encompass a measure induced by an
                   arbitrary convex positive definite function. It is
                   shown that this modified matrix measure has most of
                   the properties of the usual matrix measure, and that
                   many of the known applications of the usual matrix
                   measure can therefore be carried over to the modified
                   matrix measure. These applications include deriving
                   conditions for a mapping to be a diffeomorphism on
                   Rn, and estimating the solution errors that result
                   when a nonlinear network is approximated by a
                   piecewise linear network. We also develop a
                   connection between matrix measures and {Liapunov}
                   functions. Specifically, we show that if V is a
                   convex positive definite function and A is a Hurwitz
                   matrix, then mu V(A) < 0, if and only if V is a
                   {Liapunov} function for the system x... = Ax. This
                   linking up between matrix measures and {Liapunov}
                   functions leads to some results on the existence of a
                   “common” matrix measure μV(·) such that μV(Ai)
                   < 0 for each of a given set of matrices A1,…, Am.
                   Finally, we also give some results for matrices with
                   nonnegative off-diagonal terms.},

                   sufficient conditions for an array of linearly
                   coupled systems to synchronize, A typical result
                   states that the array will synchronize if the nonzero
                   eigenvalues of the coupling matrix have real parts
                   that are negative enough. In particular, we show that

                   diffusive coupling will synchronize an array of

                   conditionsfor synchronization for several coupling
                   configurations will be considered. For coupling that
                   leaves the array decoupled at the synchronized state,
                   the cells each follow their natural uncoupled
                   dynamics at the synchronized state. We illustrate

                   synchronization is a regime where multiple groups of
                   fully synchronized elements coexist. In the brain,
                   concurrent synchronization may occur at several
                   scales, with multiple rhythms interacting and
                   functional assemblies combining neural oscillators of
                   many different types. Mathematically, stable
                   concurrent synchronization corresponds to convergence
                   to a flow-invariant linear subspace of the global
                   state space. We derive a general condition for such
                   convergence to occur globally and exponentially. We
                   also show that, under mild conditions, global
                   convergence to a concurrently synchronized regime is

                   negative feedback or hierarchies, so that stable

                   concurrent synchronization to variations in

                   namely, semi-contraction and weak-contraction theory.
                   First, using the notion of semi-norm, we propose a
                   geometric framework for semi-contraction theory. We
                   introduce matrix semi-measures and characterize their
                   properties. We show that the spectral abscissa of a
                   matrix is the infimum over weighted semi-measures.
                   For dynamical systems, we use the semi-measure of
                   their Jacobian to characterize the contractivity
                   properties of their trajectories. Second, for weakly
                   contracting systems, we prove a dichotomy for the
                   asymptotic behavior of their trajectories and novel
                   sufficient conditions for convergence to an
                   equilibrium. Third, we show that every trajectory of
                   a doubly-contracting system, i.e., a system that is
                   both weakly and semi-contracting, converges to an
                   equilibrium point. Finally, we apply our results to
                   various important network systems including affine
                   averaging and affine flow systems, continuous-time
                   distributed primal-dual algorithms, and networks of
                   diffusively-coupled dynamical systems. For
                   diffusively-coupled systems, the semi-contraction
                   theory leads to a sufficient condition for
                   synchronization that is sharper, in general, than
                   previously-known tests.},

                   we introduce weak pairings as a framework to study
                   contractivity with respect to arbitrary norms, and
                   characterize their properties. We introduce and study
                   the sign and max pairings for the $\ell_1$ and
                   $\ell_\infty$ norms, respectively. Using weak
                   pairings, we establish five equivalent
                   characterizations for contraction, including the
                   one-sided Lipschitz condition for the vector field as
                   well as logarithmic norm and Demidovich conditions

  abstract =      {Contraction analysis considers the distance between
                   two adjacent trajectories. If this distance is
                   contracting, then trajectories have the same
                   long-term behavior. The main advantage of this
                   analysis is that it is independent of the solutions
                   under consideration. Using an appropriate metric,
                   with respect to which the distance is contracting,
                   one can show convergence to a unique equilibrium or,
                   if attraction only occurs in certain directions, to a
                   periodic orbit. Contraction analysis was originally
                   considered for ordinary differential equations, but
                   has been extended to discrete-time systems, control
                   systems, delay equations and many other types of
                   systems. Moreover, similar techniques can be applied
                   for the estimation of the dimension of attractors and
                   for the estimation of different notions of entropy
                   (including topological entropy). This review attempts
                   to link the references in both the mathematical and
                   the engineering literature and, furthermore, point
                   out the recent developments and algorithms in the
                   computation of contraction metrics.},

                   We introduce robust control contraction metrics
                   (RCCM), extending the method of control contraction
                   metrics from stabilization to disturbance attenuation
                   and robust control. An RCCM is a Riemannian metric
                   that verifies differential L2-gain bounds in
                   closed-loop, and guarantees robust stability of
                   arbitrary trajectories via small gain arguments.
                   Numerical search for such a metric can be transformed
                   to a convex optimization problem. We also show that
                   the associated Riemannian energy can be used as a

  abstract =      {We consider contractive systems whose trajectories
                   evolve on a compact and convex state-space. It is
                   well-known that if the time-varying vector field of
                   the system is periodic, then the system admits a
                   unique globally asymptotically stable periodic
                   solution. Obtaining explicit information on this
                   periodic solution and its dependence on various
                   parameters is important both theoretically and in
                   numerous applications. We develop an approach for
                   approximating such a periodic trajectory using the
                   periodic trajectory of a simpler system (e.g., an LTI
                   system). The approximation includes an error bound
                   that is based on the input-to-state stability
                   property of contractive systems. We show that in some
                   cases, this error bound can be computed explicitly.
                   We also use the bound to derive a new theoretical
                   result, namely, that a contractive system with an
                   additive periodic input behaves like a low-pass
                   filter. We demonstrate our results using several

                   understanding a wide range of biological and
                   mechanical systems. However, the conditions proved in
                   the literature for synchronization in nonlinear
                   systems with linear coupling, such as has been used
                   to model neuronal networks, are in general not strict
                   enough to accurately determine the system behavior.
                   We leverage contraction theory to derive new
                   sufficient conditions for cluster synchronization in
                   terms of the network structure, for a network where
                   the intrinsic nonlinear dynamics of each node may
                   differ. Our result requires that network connections
                   satisfy a cluster-input-equivalence condition, and we
                   explore the influence of this requirement on network
                   dynamics. For application to networks of nodes with
                   FitzHugh--Nagumo dynamics, we show that our new

                   previous analyses that used smooth or nonsmooth

                   conditions for when cluster synchronization will
                   occur based on network configuration is a significant

                   propelled by flapping fins that resemble the
                   paddle-like forelimbs of a sea turtle. Our proposed
                   framework exploits limit cycle oscillators and
                   diffusive couplings, thereby constructing coupled
                   nonlinear oscillators, similar to the central pattern
                   generators (CPGs) in animal spinal cords. This paper
                   first presents rigorous stability analyses and
                   experimental results of CPG-based control methods
                   with and without actuator feedback to the CPG. In
                   these methods, the CPG module generates synchronized
                   oscillation patterns, which are sent to
                   position-servoed flapping fin actuators as a
                   reference input. In order to overcome the limitation
                   of the open-loop CPG that the synchronization is
                   occurring only between the reference signals, this
                   paper introduces a new single-layered CPG method,
                   where the CPG and the physical layers are combined as
                   a single layer, to ensure the synchronization of the
                   physical actuators in the presence of external
                   disturbances. The key idea is to replace nonlinear
                   oscillators in the conventional CPG models with
                   physical actuators that oscillate due to nonlinear
                   state feedback of the actuator states. Using
                   contraction theory, a relatively new nonlinear
                   stability tool, we show that coupled nonlinear
                   oscillators globally synchronize to a specific
                   pattern that can be stereotyped by an outer-loop
                   controller. Results of experimentation with a
                   turtle-like AUV show the feasibility of the proposed
                   control laws.},

                   stability from the input signal's time derivatives to

                   plants composed of two strictly positive real

                   gradient-based optimization algorithms through the
                   lens of nonlinear contraction theory. It demonstrates
                   that in the case of a time-invariant objective, most
                   elementary results on gradient descent based on
                   convexity can be replaced by much more general
                   results based on contraction. In particular, gradient
                   descent converges to a unique equilibrium if its
                   dynamics are contracting in any metric, with
                   convexity of the cost corresponding to the special
                   case of contraction in the identity metric. More
                   broadly, contraction analysis provides new insights
                   for the case of geodesically-convex optimization,
                   wherein non-convex problems in Euclidean space can be
                   transformed to convex ones posed over a Riemannian
                   manifold. In this case, natural gradient descent
                   converges to a unique equilibrium if it is
                   contracting in any metric, with geodesic convexity of
                   the cost corresponding to contraction in the natural
                   metric. New results using semi-contraction provide
                   additional insights into the topology of the set of
                   optimizers in the case when multiple optima exist.
                   Furthermore, they show how semi-contraction may be
                   combined with specific additional information to
                   reach broad conclusions about a dynamical system. The
                   contraction perspective also easily extends to
                   time-varying optimization settings and allows one to
                   recursively build large optimization structures out
                   of simpler elements. Extensions to natural
                   primal-dual optimization and game-theoretic contexts
                   further illustrate the potential reach of these new

                   computations to make sense. We approached this
                   problem from a control-theory perspective by applying
                   contraction analysis to recurrent neural networks.
                   This allowed us to find mechanisms for achieving
                   stability in multiple connected networks with
                   biologically realistic dynamics, including synaptic
                   plasticity and time-varying inputs. These mechanisms
                   included inhibitory Hebbian plasticity, excitatory
                   anti-Hebbian plasticity, synaptic sparsity and
                   excitatory-inhibitory balance. Our findings shed
                   light on how stable computations might be achieved
                   despite biological complexity. Crucially, our
                   analysis is not limited to analyzing the stability of
                   fixed geometric objects in state space (e.g points,
                   lines, planes), but rather the stability of state
                   trajectories which may be complex and time-varying.},

                   spaces is well-established. For contractive (resp.
                   semi-contractive) systems, the distance (resp.
                   semi-distance) between any two trajectories decreases
                   exponentially fast. For partially contractive

                   to an invariant subspace. In this note, we develop
                   contraction theory on Hilbert spaces. First, for
                   time-invariant systems we establish the existence of
                   a unique globally exponentially stable equilibrium
                   and provide a novel integral condition for
                   contractivity. Second, we introduce the notions of
                   partial and semi-contraction and we provide various
                   sufficient conditions for time-varying and
                   time-invariant systems. Finally, we apply the theory
                   on a reaction-diffusion system.},

  abstract =      {Implicit neural networks, a.k.a., deep equilibrium
                   networks, are a class of implicit-depth learning
                   models where function evaluation is performed by
                   solving a fixed point equation. They generalize
                   classic feedforward models and are equivalent to
                   infinite-depth weight-tied feedforward networks.
                   While implicit models show improved accuracy and
                   significant reduction in memory consumption, they can
                   suffer from ill-posedness and convergence
                   instability. This paper provides a new framework to
                   design well-posed and robust implicit neural networks
                   based upon contraction theory for the non-Euclidean
                   norm $\ell_\infty$. Our framework includes (i) a
                   novel condition for well-posedness based on one-sided
                   Lipschitz constants, (ii) an average iteration for
                   computing fixed-points, and (iii) explicit estimates
                   on input-output Lipschitz constants. Additionally, we
                   design a training problem with the well-posedness
                   condition and the average iteration as constraints
                   and, to achieve robust models, with the input-output
                   Lipschitz constant as a regularizer. Our
                   $\ell_\infty$ well-posedness condition leads to a
                   larger polytopic training search space than existing
                   conditions and our average iteration enjoys
                   accelerated convergence. Finally, we perform several
                   numerical experiments for function estimation and
                   digit classification through the MNIST data set. Our
                   numerical results demonstrate improved accuracy and
                   robustness of the implicit models with smaller
                   input-output Lipschitz bounds.},

                   control of networks of grid-forming inverters is now
                   a pressing issue for power system operation. Droop
                   control is a popular control strategy in the
                   literature for frequency control of these inverters.
                   In this paper, we analyze transient stability in
                   droop-controlled inverter networks that are subject
                   to multiple operating constraints. Using two
                   physically-meaningful Lyapunov-like functions, we
                   provide two sets of criteria (one mathematical and
                   one computational) to certify that a post-fault
                   trajectory achieves frequency synchronization while
                   respecting operating constraints. We demonstrate two
                   applications of these results on a modified IEEE RTS

                   with respect to which the system is robust, and

                   theory is a useful tool in the study of consensus
                   algorithms and dynamical flow systems such as Markov

                   projection and distance seminorms. We show that the
                   well-known $\ell_p$ ergodic coefficients are induced
                   matrix seminorms and play a central role in stability

                   their study is receiving increasing attention. This
                   letter starts with the simple observation that, given
                   a strongly contracting system, its adjoint dynamical
                   system is also strongly contracting, with the same

                   infinity. We present two analogous developments. One
                   for Schur stability and the discrete-time dynamical
                   system x(t+1)=Ax(t), and the other for Hurwitz
                   stability and the continuous-time dynamical system
                   x'(t)=Ax(t). Here is a description of the latter
                   development. For A, we define and study Hurwitz
                   diagonal stability with respect to p-norms,
                   abbreviated HDSp. HDS2 is the usual concept of
                   diagonal stability. A is HDSp implies Re lambda <0
                   for every eigenvalue, which means A is Hurwitz
                   stable, abbreviated HS. When the off-diagonal
                   elements of A are nonnegative, A is HS iff A is HDSp
                   for all p. For the dynamical system x'(t)=Ax(t), we
                   define diagonally invariant exponential stability
                   relative to the p-norm, abbreviated DIESp, meaning
                   there exist time-dependent sets, which decrease
                   exponentially and are invariant with respect to the
                   system. We show that DIESp is a special type of
                   exponential stability and the dynamical system has
                   this property iff A is HDSp.},

  abstract =      {In his 1958 thesis Stability and Error Bounds,
                   Germund Dahlquist introduced the logarithmic norm in
                   order to derive error bounds in initial value
                   problems, using differential inequalities that
                   distinguished between forward and reverse time
                   integration. Originally defined for matrices, the
                   logarithmic norm can be extended to bounded linear
                   operators, but the extensions to nonlinear maps and
                   unbounded operators have required a functional
                   analytic redefinition of the concept. This compact
                   survey is intended as an elementary, but broad and
                   largely self-contained, introduction to the versatile
                   and powerful modern theory. Its wealth of
                   applications range from the stability theory of IVPs
                   and BVPs, to the solvability of algebraic, nonlinear,
                   operator, and functional equations.},

                   systems in the way similar to the matrix measure for
                   stability of linear systems. Based on the new

  abstract =      {For linear time-variant systems x˙(t)=A(t)x(t), we
                   consider Lyapunov function candidates of the form
                   Vp(x,t)=||H(t)x||p, with 1≤p≤∞, defined by
                   continuously differentiable and non-singular
                   matrix-valued functions, H(t):R+→Rn×n. We prove
                   that the traditional framework based on quadratic
                   Lyapunov functions represents a particular case (i.e.
                   p=2) of a more general scenario operating in similar
                   terms for all Hölder p-norms. We propose a unified
                   theory connecting, by necessary and sufficient
                   conditions, the properties of (i) the matrix-valued
                   function H(t), (ii) the Lyapunov function candidate
                   Vp(x,t) and (iii) the time-dependent set
                   Xp(t)={x∈Rn|||H(t)x||p≤e−rt}, with r≥0. This
                   theory allows the construction of four distinct types
                   of Lyapunov functions and, equivalently, four
                   distinct types of sets which are invariant with
                   respect to the system trajectories. Subsequently, we
                   also get criteria for testing stability, uniform
                   stability, asymptotic stability and exponential
                   stability. For all types of Lyapunov functions, the
                   matrix-valued function H(t) is a solution to a matrix
                   differential inequality (or, equivalently, matrix
                   differential equation) expressed in terms of matrix
                   measures corresponding to Hölder p-norms. Such an
                   inequality (or equation) generalizes the role played
                   by the Lyapunov inequality (equation) in the
                   classical case when p=2. Finally, we discuss the
                   diagonal-type Lyapunov functions that are easier to
                   handle (including the generalized Lyapunov
                   inequality) because of the diagonal form of H(t).},

                   concepts from the input-to-state stability and
                   network small-gain theory, we first establish
                   necessary and sufficient conditions for the stability
                   of linear positive systems described by Metzler
                   matrices. Specifically, we define and compute two
                   forms of input-to-state stability gains for Metzler
                   systems, namely max-interconnection gains and
                   sum-interconnection gains. Then, based on the
                   max-interconnection gains, we show that the cyclic
                   small-gain theorem becomes necessary and sufficient
                   for the stability of Metzler systems; based on the
                   sum-interconnection gains, we obtain novel
                   graph-theoretic conditions for the stability of
                   Metzler systems. All these conditions highlight the

                   unveil how the structural properties of the graph
                   affect stability. Finally, we extend our results to
                   the nonlinear monotone system and obtain similar

                   trajectory tracking for nonlinear control-affine
                   systems subject to external disturbances based on
                   robust control contraction metrics (CCM) that aims to
                   minimize the L gain from the disturbances to
                   nominal-actual trajectory deviations. The guarantee
                   is in the form of invariant tubes, computed offline
                   and valid for any nominal trajectories, in which the
                   actual states and inputs of the system are guaranteed
                   to stay despite disturbances. Under mild assumptions,
                   we prove that the proposed robust CCM (RCCM) approach
                   yields tighter tubes than an existing approach based
                   on CCM and input-to-state stability analysis. We show
                   how the RCCM-based tracking controller together with
                   tubes can be incorporated into a feedback motion
                   planning framework to plan safe trajectories for
                   robotic systems. Simulation results illustrate the
                   effectiveness of the proposed method and empirically
                   demonstrate reduced conservatism compared to the
                   CCM-based approach.},

                   robust motion plans for robotic systems with
                   nonlinear dynamics subject to bounded disturbances,
                   control constraints, and online state constraints
                   such as obstacles. In an offline phase, one computes
                   the structure of a feedback controller that can be
                   efficiently implemented online to track any feasible
                   nominal trajectory. The offline phase leverages
                   contraction theory, specifically, Control Contraction
                   Metrics, and convex optimization to characterize a
                   fixed-size “tube” that the state is guaranteed to
                   remain within while tracking a nominal trajectory
                   (representing the center of the tube). In the online
                   phase, when the robot is faced with obstacles, a
                   motion planner uses such a tube as a robustness
                   margin for collision checking, yielding nominal
                   trajectories that can be safely executed, that is,
                   tracked without collisions under disturbances. In
                   contrast to recent work on robust online planning
                   using funnel libraries, our approach is not
                   restricted to a fixed library of maneuvers computed
                   offline and is thus particularly well-suited to
                   applications such as UAV flight in densely cluttered
                   environments where complex maneuvers may be required
                   to reach a goal. We demonstrate our approach through
                   numerical simulations of planar and 3D quadrotors,
                   and hardware results on a quadrotor platform
                   navigating a complex obstacle environment while
                   subject to aerodynamic disturbances. The results
                   demonstrate the ability of our approach to jointly
                   balance motion safety and efficiency for agile
                   robotic systems.},

  abstract =      {In this paper, a general framework is presented for
                   analyzing the synchronization stability of Linearly
                   Coupled Ordinary Differential Equations (LCODEs). The
                   uncoupled dynamical behavior at each node is general,
                   and can be chaotic or otherwise; the coupling
                   configuration is also general, with the coupling
                   matrix not assumed to be symmetric or irreducible. On
                   the basis of geometrical analysis of the
                   synchronization manifold, a new approach is proposed
                   for investigating the stability of the
                   synchronization manifold of coupled oscillators. In
                   this way, criteria are obtained for both local and
                   global synchronization. These criteria indicate that
                   the left and right eigenvectors corresponding to
                   eigenvalue zero of the coupling matrix play key roles
                   in the stability analysis of the synchronization
                   manifold. Furthermore, the roles of the uncoupled
                   dynamical behavior on each node and the coupling
                   configuration in the synchronization process are also
                   studied.},

  abstract =      {The concept of incremental quadratic stability
                   ($\delta$QS) is very useful in treating systems with
                   persistently acting inputs. To illustrate, if a
                   time-invariant $\delta$QS system is subject to a
                   constant input or $T$-periodic input then, all its
                   trajectories exponentially converge to a unique
                   constant or $T$-periodic trajectory, respectively. By
                   considering the relationship of $\delta$QS to the
                   usual concept of quadratic stability, we obtain a
                   useful necessary and sufficient condition for
                   $\delta$QS. A main contribution of the paper is to
                   consider nonlinear/uncertain systems whose state
                   dependent nonlinear/uncertain terms satisfy an
                   incremental quadratic constraint which is
                   characterized by a bunch of symmetric matrices we
                   call incremental multiplier matrices. We obtain
                   linear matrix inequalities whose feasibility
                   guarantee $\delta$QS of these systems. Frequency
                   domain characterizations of $\delta$QS are then
                   obtained from these conditions. By characterizing
                   incremental multiplier matrices for many common
                   classes of nonlinearities, we demonstrate the
                   usefulness of our results.},

                   matrices and allow for the consideration of all
                   continuous nondecreasing neuron activation functions.
                   Such functions may be unbounded (but not necessarily
                   surjective), may have infinite intervals with zero
                   slope as in a piece-wise-linear model, or both. The
                   conditions on GAS rely on the concept of Lyapunov
                   Diagonally Stable (or Lyapunov Diagonally
                   Semi-Stable) matrices and are proved by employing a
                   class of Lyapunov functions of the generalized

                   for the class of neural circuits introduced for
                   solving linear and quadratic programming problems. In
                   this application, the principal result here obtained
                   is that these networks are GAS also when the

                   throughout neuroscience as models of local neural
                   activity. Many properties of single RNNs are well
                   characterized theoretically, but experimental
                   neuroscience has moved in the direction of studying
                   multiple interacting areas, and RNN theory needs to
                   be likewise extended. We take a constructive approach
                   towards this problem, leveraging tools from nonlinear
                   control theory and machine learning to characterize
                   when combinations of stable RNNs will themselves be

                   for massive feedback connections between interacting
                   RNNs. We parameterize these conditions for easy
                   optimization using gradient-based techniques, and
                   show that stability-constrained "networks of

                   satisfied by the nonlinearities with the use of an
                   adequate control function matrix. The contraction
                   analysis results are provided under the form of
                   linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The design of a
                   nonlinear control law (that is a control law
                   depending on nonlinearities) is proposed in order for

                   quadratic Lyapunov function is, however, nothing else
                   than a squared Euclidean norm on the state space

                   robustness analysis with respect to nonlinearities,
                   time variations, and uncertain parameters. From an
                   original idea by Yakubovich (1967), the approach has
                   been developed under a combination of influences from
                   the Western and Russian traditions of control theory.
                   It is shown how a complex system can be described,
                   using integral quadratic constraints (IQC) for its
                   elementary components. A stability theorem for
                   systems described by IQCs is presented that covers
                   classical passivity/dissipativity arguments but
                   simplifies the use of multipliers and the treatment
                   of causality. A systematic computational approach is
                   described, and relations to other methods of
                   stability analysis are discussed. Last, but not
                   least, the paper contains a summarizing list of IQCs
                   for important types of system components. (55

                   conditions involve multiplier matrices which

                   demonstrate that these conditions are also necessary

  abstract =      {This paper investigates the observer-based consensus
                   tracking problem of multi-agent systems with
                   one-sided Lipschitz nonlinearity. The agent dynamics
                   considered here covers a broad family of nonlinear
                   systems, and includes the well-known Lipschitz system
                   as a special case. To achieve consensus tracking for
                   such multi-agent systems, two types of observer-based
                   protocols named the continuous protocol and the
                   intermittent protocol are proposed. Furthermore,
                   several multi-step design algorithms are presented to
                   select the observer gains and the controller
                   parameters of the proposed protocols. It is shown
                   that the established sufficient criteria can not only
                   ensure the observer error to approach to zero, but
                   also realize the consensus tracking of multi-agent
                   systems. The obtained results are illustrated by two
                   simulation examples.},

                   neural network, the positive firing-rate competitive
                   network, to tackle sparse reconstruction problems
                   with non-negativity constraints. These problems,
                   which involve approximating a given input stimulus
                   from a dictionary using a set of sparse (active)
                   neurons, play a key role in a wide range of domains,
                   including for example neuroscience, signal
                   processing, and machine learning. First, by
                   leveraging the theory of proximal operators, we
                   relate the equilibria of a family of continuous-time
                   firing-rate neural networks to the optimal solutions
                   of sparse reconstruction problems. Then, we prove
                   that our model is a positive system and give rigorous
                   conditions for the convergence to the equilibrium.
                   Specifically, we show that the convergence: (i) only
                   depends on a property of the dictionary; (ii) is
                   linear-exponential, in the sense that initially the
                   convergence rate is at worst linear and then, after a
                   transient, it becomes exponential. We also prove a
                   number of technical results to assess the
                   contractivity properties of the neural dynamics of
                   interest. Our analysis leverages contraction theory
                   to characterize the behavior of a family of
                   firing-rate competitive networks for sparse
                   reconstruction with and without non-negativity
                   constraints. Finally, we validate the effectiveness
                   of our approach via a numerical example.},

                   susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) settings. In

                   analysis of equilibria, stability properties,
                   convergence, monotonicity, positivity, and threshold

                   traffic on a highway with a single entrance and exit.
                   The representation can be used to predict traffic's
                   evolution over time and space, including transient
                   phenomena such as the building, propagation, and
                   dissipation of queues. The easy-to-solve difference
                   equations used to predict traffic's evolution are
                   shown to be the discrete analog of the differential
                   equations arising from a special case of the
                   hydrodynamic model of traffic flow. The proposed
                   method automatically generates appropriate changes in
                   density at locations where the hydrodynamic theory
                   would call for a shockwave; i.e., a jump in density
                   such as those typically seen at the end of every
                   queue. The complex side calculations required by
                   classical methods to keep track of shockwaves are
                   thus eliminated. The paper also shows how the
                   equations can mimic the real-life development of
                   stop-and-go traffic within moving queues.},

  abstract =      {We present an efficient computational procedure for
                   finite abstraction of discrete-time mixed monotone
                   systems by considering a rectangular partition of the
                   state space. Mixed monotone systems are decomposable
                   into increasing and decreasing components, and
                   significantly generalize the well known class of
                   monotone systems. We tightly overapproximate the
                   one-step reachable set from a box of initial
                   conditions by computing a decomposition function at
                   only two points, regardless of the dimension of the
                   state space. We apply our results to verify the
                   dynamical behavior of a model for insect population
                   dynamics and to synthesize a signaling strategy for a
                   traffic network.},

                   time analog of the classical over-relaxed fixed point
                   iteration. The dynamical system is proved to converge
                   for nonexpansive mappings under all p norms, p/spl
                   isin/(1,/spl infin/). This extends previously
                   established results to not necessarily differentiable
                   maps which are nonexpansive under the /spl
                   infin/-norm. The system will always converge to a
                   single fixed point in a connected set of fixed
                   points. This allows the system to function as a
                   complementary paradigm to energy minimization
                   techniques for optimization in the analog domain. It
                   is shown that the proposed technique is applicable to

                   functions of two vector variables that have (possibly
                   a continuum of) min-max saddle points. We study the
                   asymptotic convergence properties of the associated
                   saddle-point dynamics (gradient descent in the first
                   variable and gradient ascent in the second one). We
                   identify a suite of complementary conditions under
                   which the set of saddle points is asymptotically
                   stable under the saddle-point dynamics. Our first set
                   of results is based on the convexity-concavity of the
                   function defining the saddle-point dynamics to
                   establish the convergence guarantees. For functions
                   that do not enjoy this feature, our second set of
                   results relies on properties of the linearization of
                   the dynamics, the function along the proximal normals
                   to the saddle set, and the linearity of the function
                   in one variable. We also provide global versions of
                   the asymptotic convergence results. Various examples
                   illustrate our discussion.},

                   analysis, network-reduction, and dynamics of certain
                   classes of electrical networks. We study these

                   from static resistive DC circuits, over dynamic RLC
                   circuits, to nonlinear AC power flow. We conclude
                   this paper by presenting a set of fundamental open
                   questions at the intersection of algebraic graph
                   theory and electrical networks.},

                   naturally arise in the context of convex optimization
                   problems with a unique minimizer. We show that
                   convergence to the equilibrium is
                   \emph{linear-exponential}, in the sense that the
                   distance between each solution and the equilibrium is
                   upper bounded by a function that first decreases
                   linearly and then exponentially. As we show, the

  abstract =      {For the purposes of this paper, “gossiping” is a
                   distributed process whose purpose is to enable the
                   members of a group of autonomous agents to
                   asymptotically determine, in a decentralized manner,
                   the average of the initial values of their scalar
                   gossip variables. This paper discusses several
                   different deterministic protocols for gossiping which
                   avoid deadlocks and achieve consensus under different
                   assumptions. First considered is <formula
                   formulatype="inline"><tex
                   Notation="TeX">$T$</tex></formula>-periodic gossiping
                   which is a gossiping protocol which stipulates that
                   each agent must gossip with the same neighbor exactly
                   once every <formula formulatype="inline"><tex
                   Notation="TeX">$T$</tex></formula> time units. Among
                   the results discussed is the fact that if the
                   underlying graph characterizing neighbor relations is
                   a tree, convergence is exponential at a worst case
                   rate which is the same for all possible <formula
                   formulatype="inline"><tex
                   Notation="TeX">$T$</tex></formula> -periodic gossip
                   sequences associated with the graph. Many gossiping
                   protocols are request based which means simply that a
                   gossip between two agents will occur whenever one of
                   the two agents accepts a request to gossip placed by
                   the other. Three deterministic request-based
                   protocols are discussed. Each is guaranteed to not
                   deadlock and to always generate sequences of gossip
                   vectors which converge exponentially fast. It is
                   shown that worst case convergence rates can be
                   characterized in terms of the second largest singular
                   values of suitably defined doubly stochastic

                   M(t) is a real-valued “stochastic” or “doubly

                   Certain types of stochastic and doubly stochastic

                   this paper is to find a “semi-norm” with respect
                   to which matrices from these “convergability

                   stochastic matrix S such a semi-norm is identified
                   and is shown to coincide with the second largest
                   singular value of S.},

                   of belief/opinion propagation over influence

                   the evolution of the probability distribution of

                   cooperation have been the object of extensive recent
                   research. A fundamental understanding of aggregate
                   motions in the natural world, such as bird flocks,
                   fish schools, animal herds, or bee swarms, for
                   instance, would greatly help in achieving desired
                   collective behaviors of artificial multi-agent
                   systems, such as vehicles with distributed
                   cooperative control rules. In [38], Reynolds
                   published his well-known computer model of ``boids,''
                   successfully forming an animation flock using three
                   local rules: collision avoidance, velocity matching,
                   and flock centering. Motivated by the growth of
                   colonies of bacteria, Viscek et al.[55] proposed a
                   similar discrete-time model which realizes heading
                   matching using information only from neighbors.
                   Viscek's model was later analyzed analytically [16,
                   52, 53]. Models in continuous-time [1, 22, 32, 33,
                   62] and combinations of Reynolds' three rules [21,
                   34, 35, 49, 50] were also studied. Related questions
                   can also be found e.g. in [3, 18, 20, 42], in
                   oscillator synchronization [48], as well as in

                   environment which in turn are sensed and used for
                   population coordination. Extending this motivation to
                   a general nonlinear dynamical system context, this
                   paper analyzes synchroniza- tion phenomena in
                   networks where communication and coupling between
                   nodes are mediated by shared dynamical quantities,
                   typically provided by the nodes’ environment. Our
                   model includes the case when the dynamics of the
                   shared variables themselves cannot be neglected or
                   indeed play a central part. Applications to examples
                   from system biology illustrate the approach.},

  abstract =      {This paper considers discontinuous dynamical systems,
                   i.e., systems whose associated vector field is a
                   discontinuous function of the state. Discontinuous
                   dynamical systems arise in a large number of
                   applications, including optimal control, nonsmooth
                   mechanics, and robotic manipulation. Independently of
                   the particular application, one always faces similar
                   questions when dealing with discontinuous dynamical
                   systems. The most basic one is the notion of
                   solution. We begin by introducing the notions of
                   Caratheodory, Filippov and sample-and-hold solutions,
                   discuss existence and uniqueness results for them,
                   and examine various examples. We also give specific
                   pointers to other notions of solution defined in the
                   literature. Once the notion of solution has been
                   settled, we turn our attention to the analysis of
                   stability of discontinuous systems. We introduce the
                   concepts of generalized gradient of locally Lipschitz
                   functions and proximal subdifferential of lower
                   semicontinuous functions. Building on these notions,
                   we establish monotonic properties of candidate
                   Lyapunov functions along the solutions. These results
                   are key in providing suitable generalizations of
                   Lyapunov stability theorems and the LaSalle
                   Invariance Principle. We illustrate the applicability
                   of these results in a class of nonsmooth gradient
                   flows.},

  abstract =      {Two related problems are treated in continuous time.
                   First, the state agreement problem is studied for
                   coupled nonlinear differential equations. The vector
                   fields can switch within a finite family. Associated
                   to each vector field is a directed graph based in a
                   natural way on the interaction structure of the
                   subsystems. Generalizing the work of Moreau, under
                   the assumption that the vector fields satisfy a
                   certain subtangentiality condition, it is proved that
                   asymptotic state agreement is achieved if and only if
                   the dynamic interaction digraph has the property of
                   being sufficiently connected over time. The proof
                   uses nonsmooth analysis. Second, the rendezvous
                   problem for kinematic point-mass mobile robots is
                   studied when the robotsÃ fields of view have a
                   fixed radius. The circumcenter control law of Ando et
                   al. [IEEE Trans. Robotics Automation, 15 (1999), pp.
                   818Ã 828] is shown to solve the problem. The
                   rendezvous problem is a kind of state agreement
                   problem, but the interaction structure is state
                   dependent.},

                   First, various motion coordination tasks are encoded

                   algorithms are modeled for the following cases in
                   which each processor does not need to communicate to
                   each other processor at each time instance:
                   processors may keep performing computations without
                   having to wait until they receive the messages that
                   have been transmitted to them; processors are allowed
                   to remain idle some of the time; some processors may
                   perform computations faster than others. A model for
                   asynchronous distributed computation is presented and
                   then the convergence of natural asynchronous
                   distributed versions of a large class of
                   deterministic and stochastic gradient-like algorithms
                   is analyzed. It is shown that such algorithms retain

                   centralized counterparts, provided that the time
                   between consecutive communications between processors
                   and communication delays is not too large. (19

                   et al. propose a simple but compelling discrete-time
                   model of n autonomous agents (i.e., points or
                   particles) all moving in the plane with the same
                   speed but with different headings. Each agent's
                   heading is updated using a local rule based on the
                   average of its own heading plus the headings of its
                   "neighbors." In their paper, Vicsek et al. provide
                   simulation results which demonstrate that the nearest
                   neighbor rule they are studying can cause all agents
                   to eventually move in the same direction despite the
                   absence of centralized coordination and despite the
                   fact that each agent's set of nearest neighbors
                   change with time as the system evolves. This paper
                   provides a theoretical explanation for this observed
                   behavior. In addition, convergence results are
                   derived for several other similarly inspired models.

                   switched linear system which is stable, but for which

                   subgraph of Gamma that consists of disjoint diverging
                   trees and has the maximum possible number of arcs. If
                   a digraph contains out arborescences, then maximum
                   out forests coincide with them. We consider Markov
                   chains related to a weighted digraph and prove that
