Here are some tips.  See the paragraph following for an explanation of why
these things are as they are.
<ol>
<li> To search for adjacent words (e.g., ``Riemannian manifold''), separate
words with "\+" (e.g. ``Riemannian\+manifold''). 
<li> To search for occurrences of multiple strings, enter a comma/space
separated list of keywords.
<li> To get an exact word match, add "\+\" to the beginning and end of the
string (e.g., ``\+Riemann\+'' will find occurrences of the word ``Riemann'').
<li> To match the beginning of a word, add "\+" to the beginning of the
search string, and add "\w*\+" to the end (e.g., ``\+Riemann\w*\+'' will find
all occurrences of words beginning with ``Riemann'').  Similar strategies
will get matches at the end of words - the "\w*" is a wildcard.
</ol>
<p>
The files being searched are not the full LaTeX files for the book.  Instead,
these files are processed using the program <tt>delatex</tt> (among other
things) to eliminate most of the LaTeX commands.  The words in the file are
then arranged into a list with a "+" separating words.  There is no
punctuation in the list.  If you know Perl, then the "+" separator will be
helpful.  Note that <tt>delatex</tt> does not always do a perfect job of
removing LaTeX commands.  This is particularly true for our book, since we
use many LaTeX macros.  Therefore, you may get some spurious search results.
