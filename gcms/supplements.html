<h2>Supplements for
<a href="http://motion.mee.ucsb.edu/book-gcms/"><i>Geometric Control of
Mechanical Systems</i></a></h2>

These chapters cover material not in the text, or extend material that is in
the text.  Some notes.
<ul>
<li> These supplementary chapters are not intended to be self-contained,
except when concatenated with the material in the book.
<li> Some items in the index in the supplementary material may be
cross-referenced to the index of the text.
<li> These chapters are dynamic.  That is to say, there is no ``official''
version.  Thus they may well change from time to time, so keep track of
the date.  If things become sufficiently static in the future, we may call
some version ``official,'' and then make errata for it to keep track of
changes.
<li> To refer to these supplements, here is a BiBTeX entry.

where <tt>FB/ADL:04</tt> is the label for the book.  The year and month
should be changed to match whatever is the date on the front page of the
supplementary chapters.
