<h1>Workshop on Geometric Control of Mechanical Systems</h1>
<b><font size="+1"

December 14-17, 2004<br>

<p>
The geometric theory of control for mechanical systems has reached a quite
mature state, as is evidenced by the recent appearance several monographs on
the topic.  The workshop is an outgrowth of a book written by the organizers.
The primary emphasis of this workshop is the modeling, analysis, and control
of mechanical systems.  The methods and results presented can be applied to a
large class of mechanical control systems, including applications in
robotics, autonomous vehicle control, and multi-body systems.  The workshop
presents a unified treatment of parts of control theory for mechanical
systems.  A distinctive feature of the presentation is its reliance on
techniques from differential and Riemannian geometry.  This workshop will
outline the areas of overlap between geometric mechanics and control theory
for mechanical systems.  Liberal use of examples form an integral part of the
presentation.  The workshop begins with mathematical background, motivated
through innovative approaches to physical modeling, analysis, and design
techniques.
<p>
The following describes the target audience for the workshop.
<ol>
<li> <em>Graduate students:</em> Students in engineering (e.g., robotics,
control, dynamical systems) will get an idea of the sort of background they
will need to apply the tools we discuss.  Students in mathematical sciences
will get exposure to interesting problems in control that rely on some fairly
sophisticated mathematics.  Both groups of students will learn about some
open problems in the area.
<li> <em>Researchers in application areas:</em> Researchers will be exposed
to systematic, implementable techniques for solving difficult problems in
control theory.
<li> <em>Researchers in mechanical systems theory:</em> Part of the
discussion will be directed towards open problems in the field.  In this way,
the workshop will be useful, even for specialists in the area, and hopefully
some fruitful discussions will evolve on future directions in the field.
<li> <em>Teachers:</em> Some teaching material will be made available at the
workshop to give teachers some ideas of ways the material can be effectively
presented to students.

<h3>Details on topics</h3>
<ol>
<li> <i>Problem descriptions and motivation:</i> Examples will be used to
present an overview of what will be covered during the course of the
workshop.  Problems discussed will include those of modeling,
controllability, motion planning, and stabilization.

<li> <i>Geometric modeling:</i> One of the major hurdles in applying the
techniques presented in the workshop is the differential geometric formalism
for mechanics.  This portion of the workshop will be devoted to a down to
earth discussion of the mathematics involved in the geometric modeling of
mechanical systems.  The objective will be to understand, in as concrete a
way as possible, how one goes from a physical problem description to the
components of the geometric models used in the control analysis and design.

<li> <i>Controllability:</i> One of the interesting features about mechanical
control systems is the interplay of the geometry of the system models and the
geometry of nonlinear control theory.  In this portion of the talk, this
interplay will be examined in the context of controllability.

<li> <i>Kinematic reduction and motion planning:</i> This part of the
workshop continues the controllability analysis, but now concentrating
attention on systems whose controllability is determinable to low-order.
Such systems exhibit some remarkable connections between controllability and
motion planning that will be illustrated on some nontrivial examples.

<li> <i>Perturbation methods and oscillatory stabilization:</i> This part of
the workshop focuses on the analysis of mechanical systems subject to
oscillations and on the design of control schemes that have large amplitude
and large frequency.

<li> <i>Open questions:</i> Possible open problems include (1) the geometric
analysis of singularities in modeling of mechanical systems with constraints,
(2) the design of provably correct ``locomotion gaits,'' that is, of motion
planning algorithms based on the weakest possible controllability conditions.
Other topics will arise as per the interests of the participants.
