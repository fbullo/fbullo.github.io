<a name="synopsis"><h2>Synopsis</h2></a>

<i>From the back cover:</i> The primary emphasis of this book is the
modeling, analysis, and control of mechanical systems.  The methods and
results presented can be applied to a large class of mechanical control
systems, including applications in robotics, autonomous vehicle control, and
multi-body systems.  The book is unique in that it presents a unified, rather
than an inclusive, treatment of control theory for mechanical systems.  A
distinctive feature of the presentation is its reliance on techniques from
differential and Riemannian geometry.
<p>
The book contains extensive examples and exercises, and will be suitable
for a growing number of courses in this area. It begins with the detailed
mathematical background, proceeding through innovative approaches to
physical modeling, analysis, and design techniques. Numerous examples
illustrate the proposed methods and results, while the many exercises test
basic knowledge and introduce topics not covered in the main body of the
text.
<p>
The audience of this book consists of two groups. The first group is
comprised of graduate students in engineering or mathematical sciences who
wish to learn the basics of geometric mechanics, nonlinear control theory,
and control theory for mechanical systems.  Readers will be able to
immediately begin exploring the research literature on these subjects.  The
second group consists of researchers in mechanics and control
theory. Nonlinear control theoreticians will find explicit links between
concepts in geometric mechanics and nonlinear control theory. Researchers
in mechanics will find an overview of topics in control theory that have
relevance to mechanics.
