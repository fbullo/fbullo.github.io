<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>Francesco Bullo is Distinguished Professor of Mechanical Engineering at the
University of California, Santa Barbara. He received the Laurea degree
&ldquo;summa cum laude&rdquo; in Electrical Engineering from the University of Padova,
Italy, in 1994, and the Ph.D. degree in Control and Dynamical Systems from
the California Institute of Technology in 1999. From 1998 to 2004, he was
an Assistant Professor with the Coordinated Science Laboratory at the
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Since 2004 he has been at
University of California, Santa Barbara; he is currently affiliated with
the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, the Department of
Computer Science, the Center for Control, Dynamical Systems and
Computation, and the Dynamical Neuroscience Program.
</p>
<p>Professor Bullo's research focuses on modeling, dynamics and control of
multi-agent network systems, with applications to oscillator networks,
robotic coordination, power systems, distributed computing and social
networks.  Previous work includes contributions to geometric control,
Lagrangian systems, vehicle routing, and motion planning.


</p>
<p>Professor Bullo has published more than 350+ papers in international
journals, books, and refereed conferences.  He is the coauthor, with Andrew
D. Lewis, of &ldquo;Geometric Control of Mechanical Systems&rdquo; (Springer, 2004,
0-387-22195-6); with Jorge Cortés and Sonia Martínez, of &ldquo;Distributed
Control of Robotic Networks&rdquo; (Princeton, 2009, 978-0-691-14195-4); of
&ldquo;Lectures on Network Systems&rdquo; (Kindle Direct Publishing, 2024, v1.7,
978-1986425643), and of "Contraction Theory for Dynamical Systems, 2023,
v1.1, 979-8836646806).
</p>
<p>Professor Bullo is a Fellow of ASME, IEEE, IFAC, and SIAM. He was a
Distinguished Lecturer of the IEEE Control Systems Society for 2016-18.  He
received the 2018 Distinguished Scientist Award by the Chinese Academy of
Sciences.  His articles received the 2008 CSM Outstanding Paper Award from
IEEE CSS, the 2011 and 2023 Hugo Schuck Best Paper Award from AACC, the 2013
SIAG/CST Best Paper Prize from SIAM, the 2014 Automatica Best Paper Prize
from IFAC, the 2016 Guillemin-Cauer Best Paper Award from IEEE CAS, and the
2016 TCNS Outstanding Paper Award from IEEE CSS.


Professor Bullo served as advisor or co-advisor of 28 graduated PhD
students.  He received the 2015 UCSB Outstanding Graduate Mentor Award
and the 2004 UIUC COE Outstanding Advisor Award.  His students&rsquo; papers
were finalists for the Best Student Paper Award at the IEEE Conference
on Decision and Control (2002, 2005, 2007), and the American Control
Conference (2005, 2006, 2010, 2022).
</p>
<p>Professor Bullo has served the IEEE Control Systems Society in various
roles: as President Elect / President / President Past during the
triennium 2017&ndash;2019, as 2011-2012 Vice-President for Technical Activities,
as 2013-2014 Vice-President for Publications, as 2007-2009 Elected Member
of the Board of Governors, and as Program Chair for the 2016 IEEE
Conference in Decision and Control.  Additionally, he served as Chair of
the SIAM Activity Group on Control and Systems Theory, for 2020-2021.
Finally, he served on the Editorial Boards of IEEE Transactions on
Automatic Control, ESAIM: Control, Optimization, and the Calculus of
Variations, SIAM Journal of Control and Optimization, and Mathematics of
Control, Signals, and Systems.
</p>
<p>From July 2013 to June 2017, Professor Bullo served as Mechanical
Engineering Department Chair at UCSB. In this role he had responsibilities
over academic personnel matters, educational programs, facilities
management, governance, finances, and communication/development.
