<H2>Really basic introduction to svn</h2>

<h4> Metaphor </h4>

The key concept is that the documents are in a database: the official
latest documents version is in an online database and users have local
copies. A user work cycle consists of: updating the local copy of the
documents, editing the local copy, commiting the local copy back to
the database. Multiple users can edit at the same time the same
documents and svn will do as good a job as possible at merging.

The main svn website is:
<a href="http://subversion.apache.org/">http://www.subversion.org</a>

<h4> Unix (Linux/Mac OS X) Instructions</h4>
<ul>

<li> install an "svn client" on your computer (you do not need the server,
only the client).

  Example clients are available
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Subversion_clients">
  wikipedia svn clients</a>. 

<li> ask Francesco for a userid and password

<li> create your own local working copy of the documents by typing
<br>
<strong>
  svn checkout
  https://fbsvn.me.ucsb.edu/svn/XXX --username francesco
</strong> <br>
where you should substitute your userid for "francesco", and your desired directory for XXX. 
This  instruction  creates the directory "XXX" with all relevant files inside.

<li> Each time you start working on the file(s), you should get the 
latest version by typing inside the XXX directory:  <br>
<strong>svn update</strong>

<li> <strong> if the local file is updated, you MUST reload the file in your editor before making any changes</strong>

<li> The local svn database is manipulated as if it was a unix directory:
<ul>
<li> to add a file (or a directory) to the database, say <strong> svn add filename</strong>
<li> to create a directory in the database, say <strong> svn mkdir dirname</strong>
<li> to remove a file from the database, say <strong> svn rm filename</strong>
</ul>
These commands and editing files only change the "local version" of the database.

<li> Each time you want to propagate your local changes to the main database, you should commit your 
changes back to the database by typing inside the XXX directory <br>
<strong>svn commit -m "type a message here"</strong>

<li> Look at the output of the "svn commit" command. In particular,
look for conflict warnings.  If there is a conflict, then you must resolve 
it before re-committing the changes. 
<ul>
<li> edit the file in question (e.g., New.bib or main.tex), look for the
markes <<<<<< ===== >>>>>>
 and choose the right version.
<li> type <strong>svn resolved main.tex</strong>
<li> type <strong>svn commit -m "resolved conflict"</strong>

</ul>

</ul>
