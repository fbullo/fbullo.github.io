@inproceedings{Sharma.Frazzoli.ea:SECON04,
	Abstract = {In this paper we consider improving the quantity and quality of data collected and sent to a sink over the lifetime of a network of mobile sensors. The positions of the sensors and the routing strategy chosen are the variables in our problem. The original problem is a multi-objective non-convex optimization problem and we believe it to be tough to solve. The approach taken in this paper is to break down the original problem into sub-problems and develop an iterative scheme to optimize both the quantities. We propose three sub-problems. First, we optimize the way (obtain flows) the data is sent to the sink for a fixed placement of the nodes by solving a linear program (work on this has already been done in the past by others). Once flows have been obtained, they are kept constant and the nodes are then moved in a way such that the lifetime is further improved, keeping the maximum distortion error less than or equal to what it is for the initial node placement. Then for the new node distribution with a better lifetime, we decrease the maximum distortion error keeping the lifetime greater than or equal as compared to the starting configuration. Centralized and decentralized iterative schemes are presented using these subproblems that monotonically improve the lifetime data gathering and reduce maximum distortion error at each step. },

@inproceedings{Sharma.Frazzoli.ea:CDC05,
	Abstract = {Gupta and Kumar (2000) studied the scaling of capacity of a wireless network when the nodes in the network are fixed at arbitrary locations and showed that for arbitrary setting of nodes the throughput per node achieved scales as $\Theta(1/\sqrt{n})$ when the average distance between the source and destination of bits is constant. Grossglauser and Tse (2001) showed for a random network model, where the nodes are randomly located in the environment and are mobile, a constant throughput per node is achievable by letting data travel on mobile nodes to avoid using the wireless media. In this paper, we consider a network consisting of n static nodes with constant throughput requirements and m mobile agents, which are constrained not to grow faster than a factor of $n$, such that the average distance between the origin and destination of bits is non-vanishing in the number of nodes. It is shown that for any optimal placement of nodes, arbitrary movement of mobile agents and arbitrary assignment of transmissions, in order to achieve constant throughput per node, the average distance the bits have to be transported on mobile agents is nonvanishing. We show that since the mobile agents have to stay a velocity dependent distance away from each other for safety, the time taken for them to travel a non-vanishing average distance increases with the number of agents. This directly affects the maximum delay incurred by all bits transported in the network and we show that the maximum delay is $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$. We also present a placement of static nodes, assignment of origin destination of bits whose average distance is constant, movement of mobile agents and scheduling scheme for transmissions such that the network achieves constant throughput per node and incurs a maximum delay of $O(\sqrt{n})$. },

	Abstract = {A trajectory control problem for simple micro air vehicles (MAVs) is introduced and studied. The MAVs are endowed with the ability to estimate their position and velocity and can control their drag coefficient. The objective of this work is to design a control law for the drag coefficient in order to land the MAV close to a desired streamwise location, after being dropped from an airborne carrier at low altitude. We use a simple model-predictive control law, relying on a two-dimensional time-averaged atmospheric velocity field, which is validated on an unsteady three-dimensional representation of an unstratified atmospheric boundary layer. The simulation results show that the proposed control law results in a significant (10-fold) improvement in the accuracy of the streamwise landing point location, with respect to the uncontrolled case. Similar results are obtained when errors are considered in the location of the release point and in the estimate of the mean flow field. },

The environment is free of   obstacles, and a conflict occurs when the distance between any two vehicles is smaller than a velocity-dependent safety distance.  We  derive lower and upper bounds on the time needed to complete the  transfer, in the case in which the origin and destination points can  be chosen arbitrarily, proving that the transfer takes $\Theta(\sqrt{n}\bar L)$ time to complete, where $\bar L$   is the average distance between origins and destinations. We also analyze the case in  which origin and destination points are generated randomly according  to a uniform distribution, and present an algorithm providing a  constructive upper bound on the time needed for complete the  transfer, proving that in the random case the transfer requires $O(\sqrt{n \log n})$ time.},

First,   we briefly review some previous results on the worst-case length of such   a path, and an algorithm that provides a constant factor approximation of   the worst-case optimal path length. Next, we consider the stochastic version of the problem, in which the points are randomly sampled from a uniform distribution on a compact set.

	Abstract = {  In this paper we present an architecture for real-time motion  planning, applicable to autonomous robots and vehicles. This  architecture is based on the off-line definition of a library of  ``maneuvers'', or more precisely trajectory primitives (and  corresponding feedback control laws), and on the on-line scheduling  of such primitives to achieve the mission objectives.  This leads to  the development of a hybrid ``Maneuver Automaton'', a new kind of  dynamical system where the states represent the trajectory  primitives being executed by the system, and the control input  correspond to switches between such primitives. The definition of  such a Maneuver Automaton ensures that all the trajectories  generated by such a dynamical system will satisfy all the  constraints on the vehicle's behavior --- including dynamical,  flight envelope, and control saturation constraints. In addition,  the complexity of motion planning problems is drastically reduced  using this formulation, at the expense of sub-optimality of the  generated trajectories. The results of a simple experiment on a  three degrees of freedom helicopter setup will be presented and  discussed.},

First, we obtain an upper bound on the optimal length in the point-to-point problem. Next, we consider the corresponding Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP). We provide an algorithm with worst-case performance within a constant factor approximation of the optimum. We also establish an asymptotic bound on the worstcase length of the Dubin's TSP.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we present decentralized algorithms for motion coordination of a group of autonomous vehicles, aimed at minimizing the expected waiting time to service stochastically-generated targets. The vehicles move within a convex environment with bounded velocity, and target generation is modeled by a spatio-temporal Poisson process. The general problem is known as the m-vehicle Dynamic Traveling Repairperson Problem ($m-DTRP$); the best previously known control algorithms rely on centralized a-priori task assignment and locational optimization, and are of limited applicability in scenarios involving ad-hoc networks of autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we present a new class of algorithms for the $m-DTRP$ problem that: (i) are spatially distributed, scalable to large networks, and adaptive to network changes, (ii) are provably locally optimal in the light load case, and (iii) achieve the same performance as the best known centralized algorithms in the heavy-load, single-vehicle case. Simulation results are presented and discussed. },

	Abstract = {In this paper the behavior of a typical autopilot structure is studied for flight under icing conditions. The study is based on a Twin Otter aircraft model and focuses on the pitch attitue behavior. A quadratic stability analysis using Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) is conducted to show that the time-varying closed-loop system maintains quadratic stability under icing conditions. In addition, the problem of envelope protection in the presence of icing is considered; in particular, how to maintain the angle of attack within the stall limits, which are time varying. Based on steady-state behavior, a practical envelope protection scheme is developed and tested.},

@phdthesis{Frazzoli:01,
	Abstract = {This dissertation focuses on the problem of motion planning for agile autonomous vehicles. In realistic situations, the motion planning problem must be solved in real-time, in a dynamic and uncertain environment. The fulfillment of the mission objectives might also require the exploitation of the full maneuvering capabilities of the vehicle. 
The main contribution of the dissertation is the development of a new computational and modelling framework (the Maneuver Automaton), and related algorithms, for steering underactuated, nonholonomic mechanical systems. The proposed approach is based on a quantization of the system's dynamics, by which the feasible nominal system trajectories are restricted to the family of curvesthat can be obtained by the interconnection of suitably defined primitives. This can be seen as a formalization of the concept of {\em maneuver}, allowing for the construction of a framework amenable to mathematical programming.
This motion planning framework is applicable to all time-invariant dynamical systems which admit dynamic symmetries and relative equilibria. No other assumptions are made on the dynamics, thus resulting in exact motion planning techniques of general applicability. Building on a relatively expensive off-line computation phase, we provide algorithms viable for real-time applications.
A fundamental advantage of this approach is the ability to provide a mathematical foundation for generating a provably stable and consistent hierarchical system, and for developing the tools to analyze the robustness of the system in the presence of uncertainty and/or disturbances.
In the second part of the dissertation, a randomized algorithm is proposed for real-time motion planning in a dynamic environment. By employing the optimal control solution in a free space developed for the maneuver automaton (or for any other general system), we present a motion planning algorithm  with probabilistic convergence and performance guarantees, and hard safety guarantees, even in the face of finite computation times.
The proposed methodologies are applicable to a very large class of autonomous vehicles: throughout the dissertation, examples, simulation and experimental results are presented and discussed, involving a variety of mechanical systems, ranging from simple academic examples and laboratory setups, to detailed models of small autonomous helicopters.

	Abstract = {In this paper we present algorithms and tools for  fast and efficient reachability analysis, applicable to continuous and hybrid systems. Most of the work on reachability analysis and safety verification concentrates on conservative representations of the set of reachable states, and consequently on the generation of safety certificates; however, inability to prove safety with these tools does not necessarily result in a proof of unsafety. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach, which aims at the fast falsification of safety properties; this approach provides the designer with a complementary set of tools to the ones based on conservative analysis, providing additional insight into the characteristics of the system under analysis. Our algorithms are based on algorithms originally proposed for robotic motion planning; the key idea is to incrementally grow a set of feasible trajectories by exploring the state space in an efficient way. The ability of the proposed algorithms to analyze the reachability and safety properties of general continuous and hybrid systems is demonstrated on examples from the literature.},
