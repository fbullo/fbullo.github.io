<h3>Office hours</h3>
<p>Place: Engineering Bldg II, Room 2325 or Zoom (see email for room ID)  <br />
Time: Tuesdays, 1pm-2pm as long as there are un-answered questions 
</p>
<p>If you have any questions about the course, please send me email. I will
try to respond as quickly as possible.  Additionally, I will share
questions that are particularly good (and their answers) with the rest of
the class by broadcasting my answer to the entire class.
</p>
<p>If you plan to come to ( = connect with my room) office hours for questions
about homework, please be prepared to show attempts at solving the problem
that you prepared before coming. Also, it would be desirable if you would
please email me at least 1 hour in advance.
</p>
<h2>Teaching Assistant</h2>
<p>Francesco Seccamonte, <a href="mailto:fseccamonte-at-ucsb.edu" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>fseccamonte at ucsb.edu</a><br />
Office hours Time:  Thursday, 5:30pm&ndash;7:00pm (as long as there are un-answered questions)<br />
Office hours Place: Eng. II, #2217 (or zoom). <br />
</p>
<p>Please come to office hours with prepared questions. Due to time
constraints, only limited help will be given for coding and debugging problems.
</p>
<h2>Grading</h2>
<p>Your grade will be assigned roughly according to the following percentages.
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Homework and Projects = 15% and 15%
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Midterm 35%
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Final 35%
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Partial credit might be given whenever the overall performance is low.  If
answers are not accompanied by satisfactory explanations (e.g., all
intermediate steps, clearly readable handwriting), no credit will be
given.
</p>
<p>Exams and quizzes will be closed book and closed notes. You may prepare an
exam aid (cheat sheet) in your own handwriting, consisting of one,
one-sided sheet (letter size, 8.5x11in) for the midterm and one, two-sided
sheet for the final exam.  No calculators/tablets/cellphones are allowed
during the exams (they would be useless anyway).
</p>
<p>In exceptional cases, I reserve the right to give extra points for
excellent performance on the final. Please, do not count on it as a way to
avoid doing homework assignments.
</p>
<p>Homework will is typically due on Wednesday afternoon.  No late
homework will be accepted without prior approval.  Approval is
automatic the first two times you ask: <b>to announce late homework you
must send me email by midnight the day before</b>. Late homework will
automatically lose 20% of the grade and no late homework will be
accepted after 5pm on the following Monday.
</p>
<h2>Computer Access &amp; Matlab vs Python</h2>
<p>Some of the homework and all computer laboratory
assignments will require working knowledge of Matlab or Python.
</p>
<p>I expect all of you to have access to a Matlab or Python installation.
</p>
<p>A matlab primer is available in the handout section of the course website.

<h1>Resources for Students</h1>
<p>The Division of Student Affairs provides a broad range of essential
support services and resources to help UCSB students handle the
challenges of university life.
</p>
<h2>Help during exams</h2>
<p>Students with disabilities may request academic accommodations for
exams online through the UCSB Disabled Students Program at
<a href="http://dsp.sa.ucsb.edu" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>http://dsp.sa.ucsb.edu</a>.
</p>
<p>Please make your requests for exam accommodations through the online
system as early in the quarter as possible to ensure arrangement.
</p>
<h2>Managing stress</h2>
<p>Personal concerns such as stress, anxiety, relationships, depression,
cultural differences, can interfere with the ability of students to
succeed and thrive.
</p>
<p>If you find yourself, or another student, in need of support, please
do not hesitate to reach out to Counseling and Psychological Services
(CAPS), 24/7 at (805) 893-4411. <a href="http://caps.sa.ucsb.edu" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>http://caps.sa.ucsb.edu</a>
</p>
<h2>Financial crisis response team</h2>
<p>The UCSB Financial Crisis Response Team exists to assist UCSB students
who may be facing a financial crisis or urgent financial need. In
order to apply for emergency funding, please first email
<a href="mailto:FinancialCrisis@sa.ucsb.edu" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>FinancialCrisis@sa.ucsb.edu</a>. Within 1-2 business days, a Financial Aid
Advisor will contact you for your next steps.
</p>
<h2>Gender and sex discrimination policy and student support</h2>
<p>Under Title IX, university students are protected from harassment and
discrimination based on gender and sex. If a student feels
uncomfortable or in need of support at any time related to their
gender, sex, and/or sexual orientation, please contact your TA and/or
course instructor immediately. If a student would like to disclose
information related to pronouns, name changes, or identities, we
encourage you to do so. UCSB's Resource Center for Sexual and Gender
Diversity on the 3rd floor of the Student Resource Building is also
available to advocate and be of and support to students.
</p>
<h2>Food security</h2>
<p>If you are facing any challenges securing food or housing and believe this
may affect your performance in the class, you are urged to meet with a Food
Security and Calfresh Advocate who is aware of the broad variety of
resources that UCSB has to offer (see their drop-in hours at
food.ucsb.edu). You are also urged to contact the professor or teaching
assistant if you are comfortable doing so. Please visit food.ucsb.edu for
additional resources including Calfresh, the AS Food Bank, and more.
</p>
<h2>Responsible scholarship</h2>
<p>Honesty and integrity in all academic work is essential for a valuable
educational experience.  The Office of Judicial Affairs has policies,
tips, and resources for
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>proper citation use,
</p>
</li>
<li><p>recognizing actions considered to be cheating or other forms of academic theft, and
</p>
</li>
<li><p>students&rsquo; responsibilities.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This information is available on their website at:
<a href="http://judicialaffairs.sa.ucsb.edu" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>http://judicialaffairs.sa.ucsb.edu</a>.  Students are responsible for
educating themselves on the policies and to abide by them.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, for general academic support, we encourage students to
visit Campus Learning Assistance Services (CLAS) early and often. CLAS
offers instructional groups, drop-in tutoring, writing and ESL
services, skills workshops and one-on-one consultations. CLAS is
located on the third floor of the Student Resource Building, or visit
<a href="http://clas.sa.ucsb.edu" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>http://clas.sa.ucsb.edu</a>.
