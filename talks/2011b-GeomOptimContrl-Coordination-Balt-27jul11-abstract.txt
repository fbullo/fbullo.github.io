Title: Geometry, optimization and control in robot coordination

Speaker: Francesco Bullo, University of California, Santa Barbara

Abstract: 

Motion coordination is an extraordinary phenomenon in biological systems
and a powerful tool in man-made systems; although individual agents have no
global system knowledge, complex behaviors emerge from local interactions.
This talks focuses on robotic networks, that is, group of robots that
communicate and coordinate their motions to perform useful tasks.  I will
review some recent adaptive and distributed algorithms based on concepts
from queuing and stochastic analysis, geometric optimization, and nonlinear
stability theory.
