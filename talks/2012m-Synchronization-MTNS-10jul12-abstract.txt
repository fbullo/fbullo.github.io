Title: Synchronization in Oscillator Networks and Smart Grids

Author: Francesco Bullo

Abstract:

The emergence of synchronization in complex networks of coupled oscillators
is a pervasive topic in numerous scientific disciplines including biology,
physics, chemistry, and engineering. A coupled-oscillator network is
characterized by a population of heterogeneous oscillators and a graph
describing the interaction among the oscillators. These two ingredients
give rise to rich dynamic behaviors that have fascinated the scientific
community for decades.

In this talk I will present joint work with Florian D\"orfler on novel
algebraic conditions for synchronization.  The results
exploit elegant connections among the theory of coupled oscillators, the
graph-theoretical properties of electric circuits, and multiagent dynamical
systems.

Our results are relevant in the context of future smart grids subject to
renewable stochastic power sources: assessing the existence, stability,
optimality, and robustness of synchronous states is a pervasive topic in
the study and operation of power networks.
