Title: Dynamic Vehicle Routing for Robotic Systems

Joint work with: Shaunak Bopardikar, Emilio Frazzoli, Marco Pavone, Ketan
Savla, Stephen L. Smith

Abstract: This talk surveys recent concepts and algorithms for dynamic
vehicle routing (DVR), that is, for the automatic planning of optimal
multi-vehicle routes to perform tasks that are generated over time by an
exogenous process.  We begin by reviewing the basic DVR problem: demands
for service arrive at random locations at random times and a vehicle
travels to provide on-site service while minimizing the expected wait time
of the demands. Next, we treat different multi-vehicle scenarios based on
different models for demands (e.g., demands with different priority levels,
moving demands and impatient demands), vehicles (e.g., motion constraints,
communication and sensing capabilities), and tasks.
