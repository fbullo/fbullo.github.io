Title: Distributed Linear Programming with Application to Target
       Localization and Formation Control

Joint work with: Giuseppe Notarstefano

Abstract: In this talk we discuss optimization problems over graphs and
their distributed solution. We focus on optimization problems whose
solution is demanded to multiple computation units that have bounded memory
and computation capability and that can share local information. Problems
of this sort may arise when trying to optimize a global cost function in
sensor or robotic networks, or simply when one looks for a distributed
solution of the problem by use of multiple computation resources. We
identify a novel class of distributed optimization problems, namely a
networked version of abstract linear programming. For such problems we
propose distributed algorithms for networks with various connectivity
and/or memory constraints.  Then, we show how these algorithms can be
applied to solve suitable target localization and formation control
problems.
