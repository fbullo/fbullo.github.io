Abstract: Motivated by recent interest for multi-agent systems and smart
power grid architectures, we discuss the synchronization problem for the
network-reduced model of a power system with non-trivial transfer
conductances.  Our key insight is to exploit the relationship between the
power network model and a first-order model of coupled oscillators.
Assuming overdamped generators (possibly due to local excitation
controllers), a singular perturbation analysis shows the equivalence
between the classic swing equations and a non-uniform Kuramoto oscillator
model. Here, non-uniform Kuramoto oscillators are characterized by multiple
time constants, non-homogeneous coupling, and non-uniform phase shifts.
Extending methods from transient stability, synchronization theory and
consensus protocols, we establish sufficient conditions for synchronization
of non-uniform Kuramoto oscillators.  These conditions reduce to and
improve upon previously-available tests for standard Kuramoto
model. Combining our singular perturbation and Kuramoto analyses, we derive
concise and purely algebraic conditions that relate synchronization and
transient stability of a power network to the underlying system parameters
and initial conditions.
