  abstract =      {Consider a group of individuals who must act together
                   as a team or committee, and suppose that each
                   individual in the group has his own subjective
                   probability distribution for the unknown value of
                   some parameter. A model is presented which describes
                   how the group might reach agreement on a common
                   subjective probability distribution for the parameter
                   by pooling their individual opinions. The process
                   leading to the consensus is explicitly described and
                   the common distribution that is reached is explicitly
                   determined. The model can also be applied to problems
                   of reaching a consensus when the opinion of each
                   member of the group is represented simply as a point
                   estimate of the parameter rather than as a
                   probability distribution.},

  abstract =      {The problem of identification of objects being
                   tracked by a fully decentralized surveillance system
                   is considered. A decentralized multisensor system is
                   used to track targets (people and mobile robots) as
                   they enter and move around a factory assembly room
                   performing tasks. The sensors used in this system
                   (CCD cameras) reveal information about the targets
                   that is sufficiently rich to allow them not only to
                   be tracked, but also identified as a person, a robot,
                   etc. This identity information can be used to aid in
                   man-machine interface design and to facilitate
                   situation assessment. After defining the
                   identification problem, a centralized Bayesian
                   algorithm is developed for determining the identity
                   of each target based on each sensor's information.
                   The algorithm is decentralized and its performance
                   compared to the centralized version. Results of an
                   implementation of the algorithm working on real data
                   from the surveillance system are presented},

                   tools for the analysis and design of coordination
                   algorithms for networks of mobile autonomous agents.
                   First, various motion coordination tasks are encoded
                   into aggregate cost functions from Geometric
                   Optimization. Second, the limited communication
                   capabilities of the mobile agents are modeled via the
                   notions of proximity graphs from Computational
                   Geometry and of spatially distributed maps. Finally,
                   we illustrate how to apply these tools to design and
                   analyze scalable cooperative strategies in a variety
                   of motion coordination problems such as deployment,
                   rendezvous, and flocking.},

                   which has been the focus of theory development in the

                   initially guess the binary state of the world after
                   observing a private signal. In subsequent rounds,
                   agents observe their network neighbors' previous
                   guesses before guessing again. Agents are drawn from
                   a mixture of learning types—Bayesian, who face

                   DeGroot, who average their neighbors' previous period

  abstract =      {Inspired by the so-called "bugs" problem from
                   mathematics, we study the geometric formations of
                   multi-vehicle systems under cyclic pursuit. First, we
                   introduce the notion of cyclic pursuit by examining a
                   system of identical linear agents in the plane. This
                   idea is then extended to a system of wheeled
                   vehicles, each subject to a single nonholonomic
                   constraint (i.e., unicycles), which is the principal
                   focus of this article. The pursuit framework is
                   particularly simple in that the n identical vehicles
                   are ordered such that vehicle i pursues vehicle i + 1
                   modulo n. In this article, we assume each vehicle has
                   the same constant forward speed. We show that the
                   system's equilibrium formations are generalized
                   regular polygons and it is exposed how the
                   multi-vehicle system's global behavior can be shaped
                   through appropriate controller gain assignments. We
                   then study the local stability of these equilibrium
                   polygons, revealing which formations are stable and
                   which are not. Index Terms: Cooperative control,

  abstract =      {For the purposes of this paper, “gossiping” is a
                   distributed process whose purpose is to enable the
                   members of a group of autonomous agents to
                   asymptotically determine, in a decentralized manner,
                   the average of the initial values of their scalar
                   gossip variables. This paper discusses several
                   different deterministic protocols for gossiping which
                   avoid deadlocks and achieve consensus under different
                   assumptions. First considered is <formula
                   formulatype="inline"><tex
                   Notation="TeX">$T$</tex></formula>-periodic gossiping
                   which is a gossiping protocol which stipulates that
                   each agent must gossip with the same neighbor exactly
                   once every <formula formulatype="inline"><tex
                   Notation="TeX">$T$</tex></formula> time units. Among
                   the results discussed is the fact that if the
                   underlying graph characterizing neighbor relations is
                   a tree, convergence is exponential at a worst case
                   rate which is the same for all possible <formula
                   formulatype="inline"><tex
                   Notation="TeX">$T$</tex></formula> -periodic gossip
                   sequences associated with the graph. Many gossiping
                   protocols are request based which means simply that a
                   gossip between two agents will occur whenever one of
                   the two agents accepts a request to gossip placed by
                   the other. Three deterministic request-based
                   protocols are discussed. Each is guaranteed to not
                   deadlock and to always generate sequences of gossip
                   vectors which converge exponentially fast. It is
                   shown that worst case convergence rates can be
                   characterized in terms of the second largest singular
                   values of suitably defined doubly stochastic
                   matrices.},

  abstract =      {Recently, significant attention has been dedicated to
                   the models of opinion dynamics in which opinions are
                   described by real numbers, and agents update their
                   opinions synchronously by averaging their neighbors'
                   opinions. The neighbors of each agent can be defined
                   as either (1) those agents whose opinions are in its
                   ``confidence range,'' or (2) those agents whose
                   ``influence range'' contain the agent's opinion. The
                   former definition is employed in Hegselmann and
                   Krause's bounded confidence model, and the latter is
                   novel here. As the confidence and influence ranges
                   are distinct for each agent, the heterogeneous
                   state-dependent interconnection topology leads to a
                   poorly-understood complex dynamic behavior. In both
                   models, we classify the agents via their
                   interconnection topology and, accordingly, compute
                   the equilibria of the system. Then, we define a
                   positive invariant set centered at each equilibrium
                   opinion vector. We show that if a trajectory enters
                   one such set, then it converges to a steady state
                   with constant interconnection topology. This result
                   gives us a novel sufficient condition for both models
                   to establish convergence, and is consistent with our
                   conjecture that all trajectories of the bounded
                   confidence and influence models eventually converge
                   to a steady state under fixed topology. Furthermore,
                   we study the trajectories of systems with fixed
                   interconnection topology, and prove the existence of
                   a leader group for each group of agents that
                   determines the follower's rate and direction of
                   convergence.},

  abstract =      {This article provides a comprehensive analysis of the
                   following optimization problem: maximize the entropy
                   rate generated by a Markov chain over a connected
                   graph of order~$n$ and subject to a prescribed
                   stationary distribution. First, we show that this
                   problem is strictly convex with global optimum lying
                   in the interior of the feasible space. Second, using
                   Lagrange multipliers we provide a closed-form
                   expression for the maxentropic Markov chain as a
                   function of an $n$-dimensional vector, referred to as
                   the maxentropic vector; we provide a
                   provably-converging iteration to compute this vector.
                   Third, we show that the maxentropic Markov chain is
                   reversible, compute its entropy rate, and describe
                   special cases, among other results. Fourth, through
                   analysis and simulations, we show that our proposed
                   procedure is more computationally efficient than
                   semidefinite programming methods. Finally, we apply
                   these results to robotic surveillance problems. We
                   show realizations of the maxentropic Markov chains
                   over prototypical robotic roadmaps and find that
                   maxentropic Markov chains outperform minimum mean
                   hitting time Markov chains for so-called
                   ``intelligent intruders'' with short attack

                   acceptance probability, using the notion of vorticity
                   matrix. The resulting Markov chain is non-reversible.

                   opinion has fascinated economists and sociologists
                   for long time. In many of the models, a group of
                   people in a social network, each holding a numerical
                   opinion, arrive at a shared opinion through repeated
                   averaging with their neighbors in the network.
                   Motivated by the observation that in reality
                   consensus is rarely reached, we study a related
                   sociological model in which individuals' intrinsic
                   beliefs counterbalance the averaging process and
                   yield a diversity of opinions. We interpret the
                   repeated averaging process as best-response dynamics
                   in an underlying game with natural payoffs and its
                   limit as an equilibrium. This allows us to study the
                   cost of disagreement by comparing between the cost at
                   equilibrium and the social optimum. We also consider
                   a natural network design problem in this setting:
                   which links can we add to the underlying network to
                   reduce the cost at equilibrium?},

                   subgraph of Gamma that consists of disjoint diverging
                   trees and has the maximum possible number of arcs. If

                   of electrical networks ranging from miniature
                   integrated circuits to continental-scale power
                   systems. Conversely, many fundamental results of
                   algebraic graph theory were laid out by early
                   electrical circuit analysts. In this paper we survey
                   some fundamental and historic as well as recent
                   results on how algebraic graph theory informs
                   electrical network analysis, dynamics, and design. In
                   particular, we review the algebraic and spectral
                   properties of graph adjacency, Laplacian, incidence,
                   and resistance matrices and how they relate to the
                   analysis, network-reduction, and dynamics of certain
                   classes of electrical networks. We study these

                   from static resistive DC circuits, over dynamic RLC
                   circuits, to nonlinear AC power flow. We conclude
                   this paper by presenting a set of fundamental open
                   questions at the intersection of algebraic graph
                   theory and electrical networks.},

  volume =        {60},

  abstract =      {Consider a weighted and undirected graph, possibly
                   with self-loops, and its corresponding Laplacian
                   matrix, possibly augmented with additional diagonal
                   elements corresponding to the self-loops. The Kron
                   reduction of this graph is again a graph whose
                   Laplacian matrix is obtained by the Schur complement
                   of the original Laplacian matrix with respect to a
                   subset of nodes. The Kron reduction process is
                   ubiquitous in classic circuit theory and in related
                   disciplines such as electrical impedance tomography,
                   smart grid monitoring, transient stability assessment
                   in power networks, or analysis and simulation of
                   induction motors and power electronics. More general
                   applications of Kron reduction occur in sparse matrix
                   algorithms, multi-grid solvers, finite-element
                   analysis, and Markov chains. The Schur complement of
                   a Laplacian matrix and related concepts have also
                   been studied under different names and as purely
                   theoretic problems in the literature on linear
                   algebra. In this paper we propose a general
                   graph-theoretic framework for Kron reduction that
                   leads to novel and deep insights both on the
                   mathematical and the physical side. We show the
                   applicability of our framework to various practical
                   problem setups arising in engineering applications
                   and computation. Furthermore, we provide a
                   comprehensive and detailed graph-theoretic analysis
                   of the Kron reduction process encompassing
                   topological, algebraic, spectral, resistive, and
                   sensitivity analyses. Throughout our theoretic
                   elaborations we especially emphasize the practical
                   applicability of our results.},

  abstract =      {The Kronecker product has a rich and very pleasing
                   algebra that supports a wide range of fast, elegant,
                   and practical algorithms. Several trends in
                   scientific computing suggest that this important
                   matrix operation will have an increasingly greater
                   role to play in the future. First, the application
                   areas where Kronecker products abound are all
                   thriving. These include signal processing, image
                   processing, semidefinite programming, and quantum
                   computing. Second, sparse factorizations and
                   Kronecker products are proving to be a very effective
                   way to look at fast linear transforms. Researchers
                   have taken the Kronecker methodology as developed for
                   the fast Fourier transform and used it to build
                   exciting alternatives. Third, as computers get more
                   powerful, researchers are more willing to entertain
                   problems of high dimension and this leads to
                   Kronecker products whenever low-dimension techniques
                   are “tensored” together.},

                   many applications, e.g., analysis of electrical
                   networks, analysis of chemical and biological
                   pathways, periodic scheduling, and graph drawing.
                   From a mathematical point of view, cycles in graphs
                   have a rich structure. Cycle bases are a compact
                   description of the set of all cycles of a graph. In
                   this paper, we survey the state of knowledge on cycle
                   bases and also derive some new results. We introduce
                   different kinds of cycle bases, characterize them in
                   terms of their cycle matrix, and prove structural
                   results and a priori length bounds. We provide
                   polynomial algorithms for the minimum cycle basis
                   problem for some of the classes and prove
                   APX-hardness for others. We also discuss three
                   applications and show that they require different
                   kinds of cycle bases.},

  abstract =      {Synchronization coupled oscillators networks is a
                   remarkable phenomenon of relevance in numerous
                   fields. A key question is how to characterize the
                   transition from synchrony to incoherence. For
                   Kuramoto oscillators the loss of synchronization is
                   determined by a trade-off between coupling strength
                   and oscillator heterogeneity. Despite extensive prior
                   work, the existing sufficient conditions for
                   synchronization are either very conservative or
                   heuristic and approximate. This paper proposes a
                   novel approach to the study of Kuramoto oscillators
                   based on an oblique projection operator, called the
                   cutset projection. We propose a novel family of
                   sufficient synchronization conditions; these
                   conditions rigorously identify the correct functional
                   form of the trade-off between coupling strength and
                   oscillator heterogeneity. To overcome the need to
                   solve a nonconvex optimization problem, we then
                   provide two explicit bounding methods, thereby
                   obtaining (i) the best-known sufficient condition
                   based on the 2-norm, and (ii) the first-know
                   generally-applicable sufficient condition based on
                   the $\infty$-norm. We conclude with a comparative
                   study of the novel conditions for specific topologies
                   and IEEE test cases; for IEEE test cases our new
                   sufficient conditions are always more accurate, in
                   most cases by one to two orders of magnitude, than
                   previous rigorous tests.},

                   of results is based on the convexity-concavity of the
                   function defining the saddle-point dynamics to
                   establish the convergence guarantees. For functions
                   that do not enjoy this feature, our second set of
                   results relies on properties of the linearization of
                   the dynamics, the function along the proximal normals
                   to the saddle set, and the linearity of the function
                   in one variable. We also provide global versions of
                   the asymptotic convergence results. Various examples
                   illustrate our discussion.},

                   diseases over contact networks with
                   strongly-connected topologies. We consider network
                   models for susceptible-infected (SI),
                   susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS), and
                   susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) settings. In
                   each setting, we provide a comprehensive nonlinear
                   analysis of equilibria, stability properties,
                   convergence, monotonicity, positivity, and threshold
                   conditions. For the network SI setting, specific
                   contributions include establishing its equilibria,
                   stability, and positivity properties. For the network
                   SIS setting, we review a well- known deterministic

                   characterization of the endemic state (when the

                   alternative proofs for some of its properties.
                   Finally, for the network SIR setting, we propose

                   disease transmission model based on a system of
                   ordinary differential equations. It is shown that, if

                   determining whether or not a given LTI system x˙=Ax
                   is diagonally stable. More precisely, this problem is
                   concerned with determining conditions on a matrix A
                   such that there exists a diagonal matrix D with
                   positive diagonal entries (i.e. a positive diagonal
                   matrix), satisfying ATD+DA=-Q<0. While this problem
                   has attracted much attention over the past half
                   century, two results of note stand out: (i) a result
                   based on Theorems of the Alternative derived by
                   Barker, Berman and Plemmons; and (ii) algebraic
                   conditions derived by Redheffer. This paper is
                   concerned with the second of these conditions. Our
                   principal contribution is to show that Redheffer’s
                   result can be obtained from the
                   Kalman–Yacubovich–Popov lemma. We then show that
                   this method of proof leads to natural generalisations
                   of Redheffer’s result and we use these results to
                   derive new conditions for diagonal and Hurwitz
                   stability for special classes of matrices.},

  abstract =      {This paper is concerned with the analysis and
                   synthesis of interconnected systems constructed from
                   heterogeneous positive subsystems and a nonnegative
                   interconnection matrix. We first show that
                   admissibility, to be defined in this paper, is an
                   essential requirement in constructing such
                   interconnected systems. Then, we clarify that the
                   interconnected system is admissible and stable if and
                   only if a Metzler matrix, which is built from the
                   coefficient matrices of positive subsystems and the
                   nonnegative interconnection matrix, is Hurwitz
                   stable. By means of this key result, we further
                   provide several results that characterize the
                   admissibility and stability of the interconnected
                   system in terms of the Frobenius eigenvalue of the
                   interconnection matrix and the weighted L1- induced
                   norm of the positive subsystems again to be defined
                   in this paper. Moreover, in the case where every
                   subsystem is SISO, we provide explicit conditions
                   under which the interconnected system has the
                   property of persistence, i.e., its state converges to
                   a unique strictly positive vector (that is known in
                   advance up to a strictly positive constant
                   multiplicative factor) for any nonnegative and
                   nonzero initial state. As an important consequence of
                   this property, we show that the output of the
                   interconnected system converges to a scalar multiple
                   of the right eigenvector of a nonnegative matrix
                   associated with its Frobenius eigenvalue, where the
                   nonnegative matrix is nothing but the interconnection
                   matrix scaled by the steady-stage gains of the
                   positive subsystems. This result is then naturally
                   and effectively applied to formation control of
                   multiagent systems with positive dynamics. This
                   result can be seen as a generalization of a
                   well-known consensus algorithm that has been
                   basically applied to interconnected systems
                   constructed from integrators.},

                   an associated symmetric Laplacian matrix. Some basic

                   network small-gain theory, we first establish
                   necessary and sufficient conditions for the stability
                   of linear positive systems described by Metzler
                   matrices. Specifically, we define and compute two
                   forms of input-to-state stability gains for Metzler
                   systems, namely max-interconnection gains and
                   sum-interconnection gains. Then, based on the
                   max-interconnection gains, we show that the cyclic
                   small-gain theorem becomes necessary and sufficient
                   for the stability of Metzler systems; based on the
                   sum-interconnection gains, we obtain novel
                   graph-theoretic conditions for the stability of
                   Metzler systems. All these conditions highlight the
                   role of cycles in the interconnection graph and
                   unveil how the structural properties of the graph
                   affect stability. Finally, we extend our results to
                   the nonlinear monotone system and obtain similar
                   sufficient conditions for global asymptotic
                   stability.},

                   qualitatively analyze equilibrium flows as well as
                   convergence. Flows at a junction are determined by
                   downstream supply of capacity as well as upstream
                   demand of traffic wishing to flow through the
                   junction. This approach is rooted in the celebrated
                   Cell Transmission Model for freeway traffic flow.
                   Unlike related results which rely on certain system
                   cooperativity properties, our model generally does
                   not possess these properties. We show that the lack
                   of cooperativity is in fact a useful feature that
                   allows traffic control methods, such as ramp
                   metering, to be effective. Finally, we leverage the

                   program for optimal ramp metering.},

  abstract =      {The rendezvous problem can be seen as the simplest
                   instance of coordinated control of autonomous agents.
                   This problem has been widely investigated in the
                   recent years. It is clear that the information
                   exchange must have an important influence on the
                   performance of the control strategy. In this
                   contribution the information flow is modelled by a
                   graph representing the information transmission from
                   one vehicle to another one. In this graph there exist
                   two kinds of edges. One kind represents the exact
                   data transmission. This is very expensive with
                   respect to the communication rate required. A second
                   kind of edges represents the transmission logarithmic
                   quantized data. On the contrary this is very cheap
                   with respect to communication rate required. The
                   final goal of the present paper is to determine how
                   the degree of connection of this graph influences the
                   performance of the coordinated control system.},

                   algorithms are modeled for the following cases in
                   which each processor does not need to communicate to
                   each other processor at each time instance:
                   processors may keep performing computations without
                   having to wait until they receive the messages that
                   have been transmitted to them; processors are allowed
                   to remain idle some of the time; some processors may
                   perform computations faster than others. A model for
                   asynchronous distributed computation is presented and
                   then the convergence of natural asynchronous
                   distributed versions of a large class of
                   deterministic and stochastic gradient-like algorithms
                   is analyzed. It is shown that such algorithms retain
                   the desirable convergence properties of their
                   centralized counterparts, provided that the time
                   between consecutive communications between processors
                   and communication delays is not too large. (19

  abstract =      {Two related problems are treated in continuous time.
                   First, the state agreement problem is studied for
                   coupled nonlinear differential equations. The vector
                   fields can switch within a finite family. Associated
                   to each vector field is a directed graph based in a
                   natural way on the interaction structure of the
                   subsystems. Generalizing the work of Moreau, under
                   the assumption that the vector fields satisfy a
                   certain subtangentiality condition, it is proved that
                   asymptotic state agreement is achieved if and only if
                   the dynamic interaction digraph has the property of
                   being sufficiently connected over time. The proof
                   uses nonsmooth analysis. Second, the rendezvous
                   problem for kinematic point-mass mobile robots is
                   studied when the robotsÃ fields of view have a
                   fixed radius. The circumcenter control law of Ando et
                   al. [IEEE Trans. Robotics Automation, 15 (1999), pp.
                   818Ã 828] is shown to solve the problem. The
                   rendezvous problem is a kind of state agreement
                   problem, but the interaction structure is state
                   dependent.},

                   et al. propose a simple but compelling discrete-time
                   model of n autonomous agents (i.e., points or
                   particles) all moving in the plane with the same
                   speed but with different headings. Each agent's
                   heading is updated using a local rule based on the
                   average of its own heading plus the headings of its
                   "neighbors." In their paper, Vicsek et al. provide
                   simulation results which demonstrate that the nearest
                   neighbor rule they are studying can cause all agents
                   to eventually move in the same direction despite the
                   absence of centralized coordination and despite the
                   fact that each agent's set of nearest neighbors
                   change with time as the system evolves. This paper
                   provides a theoretical explanation for this observed
                   behavior. In addition, convergence results are
                   derived for several other similarly inspired models.
                   The Vicsek model proves to be a graphic example of a
                   switched linear system which is stable, but for which
                   there does not exist a common quadratic Lyapunov

                   consensus systems that preserve the average “on

                   bound on the mean square deviation of the consensus
                   value from the initial average. Then, we apply our
                   result to systems in which few or weakly correlated
                   interactions take place: these assumptions cover
                   several algorithms proposed in the literature. For
                   such systems we show that, when the network size
                   grows, the deviation tends to zero, and that the
                   speed of this decay is not slower than the inverse of
                   the size. Our results are based on a new approach,
                   which is unrelated to the convergence properties of
                   the system.},

                   in the case when the interconnection topology is
                   fixed and directed. Then a sufficient condition is
                   proposed in the case when the coupling topology is

                   conditions in terms of linear matrix inequalities

  abstract =      {The emergence of synchronization in a network of
                   coupled oscillators is a fascinating subject of
                   multidisciplinary research. This survey reviews the
                   vast literature on the theory and the applications of
                   complex oscillator networks. We focus on phase
                   oscillator models that are widespread in real-world
                   synchronization phenomena, that generalize the
                   celebrated Kuramoto model, and that feature a rich
                   phenomenology. We review the history and the
                   countless applications of this model throughout
                   science and engineering. We justify the importance of
                   the widespread coupled oscillator model as a locally
                   canonical model and describe some selected
                   applications relevant to control scientists,
                   including vehicle coordination, electric power
                   networks, and clock synchronization. We introduce the
                   reader to several synchronization notions and
                   performance estimates. We propose analysis approaches
                   to phase and frequency synchronization, phase
                   balancing, pattern formation, and partial
                   synchronization. We present the sharpest known
                   results about synchronization in networks of
                   homogeneous and heterogeneous oscillators, with
                   complete or sparse interconnection topologies, and in
                   finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional settings.
                   We conclude by summarizing the limitations of
                   existing analysis methods and by highlighting some
                   directions for future research.},

                   self-ordered motion in systems of particles with
                   biologically motivated interaction. In our model
                   particles are driven with a constant absolute
                   velocity and at each time step assume the average
                   direction of motion of the particles in their
                   neighborhood with some random perturbation ( eta )
                   added. We present numerical evidence that this model
                   results in a kinetic phase transition from no
                   transport (zero average velocity, |va| = 0) to finite
                   net transport through spontaneous symmetry breaking
                   of the rotational symmetry. The transition is
                   continuous, since |va| is found to scale as ( eta c-
                   eta ) beta with beta ~=0.45.},

                   large systems such as power networks, traffic
                   networks and chemical reaction networks. However,
                   many such applications in science and engineering can
                   be efficiently modeled using the concept of positive
                   systems and the nonlinear counterpart monotone
                   systems. It is therefore of great interest to see how
                   such models can be used for control. This paper
                   demonstrates how positive systems can be exploited
                   for analysis and design of large-scale control
                   systems. Methods for synthesis of distributed
                   controllers are developed based on linear Lyapunov
                   functions and storage functions instead of quadratic
                   ones. The main results are extended to frequency
                   domain input–output models using the notion of
                   positively dominated system. Applications to
                   transportation networks and vehicle formations are

  abstract =      {This paper considers discontinuous dynamical systems,
                   i.e., systems whose associated vector field is a
                   discontinuous function of the state. Discontinuous
                   dynamical systems arise in a large number of
                   applications, including optimal control, nonsmooth
                   mechanics, and robotic manipulation. Independently of
                   the particular application, one always faces similar
                   questions when dealing with discontinuous dynamical
                   systems. The most basic one is the notion of
                   solution. We begin by introducing the notions of
                   Caratheodory, Filippov and sample-and-hold solutions,
                   discuss existence and uniqueness results for them,
                   and examine various examples. We also give specific
                   pointers to other notions of solution defined in the
                   literature. Once the notion of solution has been
                   settled, we turn our attention to the analysis of
                   stability of discontinuous systems. We introduce the
                   concepts of generalized gradient of locally Lipschitz
                   functions and proximal subdifferential of lower
                   semicontinuous functions. Building on these notions,
                   we establish monotonic properties of candidate
                   Lyapunov functions along the solutions. These results
                   are key in providing suitable generalizations of
                   Lyapunov stability theorems and the LaSalle
                   Invariance Principle. We illustrate the applicability
                   of these results in a class of nonsmooth gradient
                   flows.},

  abstract =      {The celebrated Kuramoto model captures various
                   synchronization phenomena in biological and man-made
                   dynamical systems of coupled oscillators. It is
                   well-known that there exists a critical coupling
                   strength among the oscillators at which a phase
                   transition from incoherency to synchronization
                   occurs. This paper features four contributions.
                   First, we characterize and distinguish the different
                   notions of synchronization used throughout the
                   literature and formally introduce the concept of
                   phase cohesiveness as an analysis tool and
                   performance index for synchronization. Second, we
                   review the vast literature providing necessary,
                   sufficient, implicit, and explicit estimates of the
                   critical coupling strength in the finite and
                   infinite-dimensional case and for both first-order
                   and second-order Kuramoto models. Third, we present
                   the first explicit necessary and sufficient condition
                   on the critical coupling strength to achieve
                   synchronization in the finite-dimensional Kuramoto
                   model for an arbitrary distribution of the natural
                   frequencies. The multiplicative gap in the
                   synchronization condition yields a practical
                   stability result determining the admissible initial
                   and the guaranteed ultimate phase cohesiveness as
                   well as the guaranteed asymptotic magnitude of the
                   order parameter. As supplementary results, we provide
                   a statistical comparison of our synchronization
                   condition with other conditions proposed in the
                   literature, and we show that our results also hold
                   for switching and smoothly time-varying natural
                   frequencies. Fourth and finally, we extend our
                   analysis to multi-rate Kuramoto models consisting of
                   second-order Kuramoto oscillators with inertia and
                   viscous damping together with first-order Kuramoto
                   oscillators with multiple time constants. We prove
                   that such a heterogeneous network is locally
                   topologically conjugate to a first-order Kuramoto
                   model with scaled natural frequencies. Finally, we
                   present necessary and sufficient conditions for
                   almost global phase synchronization and local
                   frequency synchronization in the multi-rate Kuramoto
                   model. Interestingly, our provably correct
                   synchronization conditions do not depend on the
                   inertiae which contradicts prior observations on the
                   role of inertial effects in synchronization of
                   second-order Kuramoto oscillators.},

                   distribution. If the coupling strength exceeds a
                   certain threshold, the system exhibits a phase
                   transition: some of the oscillators spontaneously
                   synchronize, while others remain incoherent. The

  abstract =      {Motivated by the recent and growing interest in smart
                   grid technology, we study the operation of DC/AC
                   inverters in a lossless microgrid. We show that a
                   network of loads and DC/AC inverters equipped with
                   power-frequency droop controllers can be cast as a
                   Kuramoto model of phase-coupled oscillators. This
                   novel description, together with results from the
                   theory of coupled oscillators, allows us to
                   characterize the behavior of the network of inverters
                   and loads. Specifically, we provide a necessary and
                   sufficient condition for the existence of a
                   synchronized solution that is unique and locally
                   exponentially stable. We present a selection of
                   controller gains leading to a desirable sharing of
                   power among the inverters, and specify the set of
                   loads which can be serviced without violating given
                   actuation constraints. Moreover, we propose a
                   distributed integral controller based on averaging
                   algorithms, which dynamically regulates the system
                   frequency in the presence of a time-varying load.
                   Remarkably, this distributed-averaging integral
                   controller has the additional property that it
                   preserves the power sharing properties of the primary
                   droop controller. Our results hold without
                   assumptions on identical line characteristics or
                   voltage magnitudes.},

                   natural systems now take advantage of the recent
                   theory of complex networks. In this review, we report
                   the advances in the comprehension of synchronization
                   phenomena when oscillating elements are constrained
                   to interact in a complex network topology. We also
                   take an overview of the new emergent features coming
                   out from the interplay between the structure and the
                   function of the underlying patterns of connections.
                   Extensive numerical work as well as analytical
                   approaches to the problem are presented. Finally, we
