                   is an open source set of Python classes and functions
                   that implement common operations for the analysis and
                   design of feedback control systems. In addition to
                   support for standard LTI control systems (including
                   time and frequency response, block diagram algebra,
                   stability and robustness analysis, and control system
                   synthesis), the package provides support for
                   nonlinear input/output systems, including system
                   interconnection, simulation, and describing function
                   analysis. A MATLAB compatibility layer provides an
                   many of the common functions corresponding to
                   commands available in the MATLAB Control Systems
                   Toolbox. The library takes advantage of the Python
                   "scientific stack" of Numpy, Matplotlib, and Jupyter
                   Notebooks and offers easy interoperation with other
                   category-leading software systems in data science,
                   machine learning, and robotics that have largely been
                   built on Python.},
