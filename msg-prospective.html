<h1>Professor Francesco Bullo - Advice for Prospective Students<br /></h1>
</div>
<h3>Dear Prospective Student:</h3>
<p>Thank you very much for your interest in my research group.  It is an honor
for me that you consider the possibility of working with me for your
graduate studies.
</p>
<p>I have written this message to share some useful information about the UCSB
graduate program. Unfortunately I will be unable to followup this message
with responses to other questions you may have.  I sincerely regret that I
cannot reply in greater detail, but I receive an overwhelming number of
emails on a regular basis.
</p>
<h2>My first advice is to learn what we do</h2>
<p>If you believe that my research area might interest you, please look
carefully at my and our web pages to learn about it.  You should feel free
to download presentation slides and papers.
</p>
<p>In general, I am more likely to be interested in a student who has taken
the time to get some idea of what my research involves, especially if they
can explain why they would be well-suited to make contributions in my
research group.
</p>
<h2>Openings are available with the ME department at UCSB</h2>
<p>Good news: the Mechanical Engineering Department at UCSB does offer
financial support for incoming graduate students.  The process is
documented online at http:<i></i>www.me.ucsb.edu (first click &ldquo;Graduate
Student Information&rdquo; at the bottom, and then click &ldquo;Graduate
Admission&rdquo;). The process begins with a pre-application, and it
includes an application fee, a statement of purpose, letters of
recommendation, etc.
</p>
<p>It is highly unlikely that I would offer a research assistantship
before getting to know a student well or before receiving a strong
recommendation from somebody I know personally.
</p>
<p>The preferred way to become my student is to submit a full
application to UCSB in the Mechanical Engineering (or related
department) and be admitted.  Your application is stronger if your
statement of purpose mentions my name and discusses how your
preparation and interests are aligned with my research (see above).
If you decide to follow this avenue, please do send me an email and
let me know.
</p>
<p>Finally, it is appropriate for me to share some statistics. On a typical
year the department receives a few hundred applications. We are financially
capable of making only a very small number of offers. In other words,
admission is unfortunately very competitive.
</p>
<h2>Your preparation</h2>
<p>Most students ask me &ldquo;how likely is it I would be admitted with
financial support and work with you&rdquo;.  This is a really difficult
question for me to answer because it depends on many factors outside
my control (e.g., admission committee, funding availability, good
match between your background and current research projects,
etc). Nevertheless, here are some achievements that helped
recently-admitted students: research experience and publications in
international venues, undergraduate and possibly masters degree from a
top school, and/or strong reference letters from
internationally-renowned professors.
</p>
<p>My research focuses on mathematical and fundamental aspects of
control, robotics, networks and multi-agent systems. Therefore, my
emphasis is on students with strong mathematical preparation and
skills, almost independently of their undergraduate degree (Mechanical
Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Aerospace
Engineering, Computer Science or Mathematics).
</p>
<h2>My goals for students</h2>
<p>The possibility of working with exceptional PhD students is
the key reason I'm a professor.  I have been able to and I
intend to provide strong personal guidance to maximize the
student's chances of building a rewarding and enjoyable
career in academic or industrial research.  Important goals
that I envision for a PhD student are:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>the development of a strong technical background and a thorough
understanding of current literature;
</p>
</li>
<li><p>the identification of fundamental research problems and the 
proposal of independent and innovative solutions to challenging 
problems;
</p>
</li>
<li><p>the presentation and publication of research in the most
prestigious journals and conferences;
</p>
</li>
<li><p>the development of personal communication and
presentation skills that are needed to maximize
visibility in the research community and ability to
succeed in job interviews;
</p>
</li>
<li><p>some experience in teaching a course, writing a proposal,
running an experiment, designing a software project.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you find this emphasis and my research area appealing, I
believe our group could provide you with a vibrant and
exciting educational experience.
</p>
<h2>Please do not email me repeatedly. Here is a summary:</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Again, I sincerely regret that I cannot reply in greater detail, but I
receive an overwhelming number of emails on a regular basis.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>For example, I cannot offer my personal evaluation of the likelihood of
success of each applicant who write me. Please accept my apologies.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Again, I repeat: we receive hundreds of applications every year.
<b>Historically, I can make at most one offer and for 2026/27, it is
unlikely I will have a position</b>. Therefore, the chances
of admission are very small. 
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Unfortunately I will be unable to followup this message
with responses to other questions you may have.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Finally, I would like to wish you the very best in your
upcoming graduate studies!
</p>
<p>With my kindest regards<br />
Francesco Bullo
